Whether it was the tengu who soared on dark wings or the Kitsune Saiguu who once walked by her side, but who eventually disappeared forever...\nThese countless tales have come to rest within her heart, and someday, they will surely shine again in the eternal paradise of her dreams.",

    "Description": "Compact assistance meka developed to increase the overall utilization rates of meka teams, providing aid for underwater projects. They were originally designed to remove junk, vegetation, and other underwater debris in order to prevent these from clogging up the vital parts of other clockwork meka, thereby minimizing failure rates. From another point of view, they are undoubtedly benefiting Fontaine's ecosystem greatly as underwater cleaners.\nEquipped with high-sensitivity sensors, the meka can efficiently \"nose out\" target items through smells as well as detect the optical characteristics of underwater junk. As a result, they can be attracted by certain types of bait and are occasionally caught by anglers, who refer to them as \"Water Maintenance Fish\" or \"Iron Fish.\"\nCompared to the mass-deployed \"Initial Configuration\" model, the \"Water Body Cleaner\" model is more mature and coated with erosion-resistant material. The researchers responsible for this project introduced periodic callback and maintenance instead of just leaving them on their own after release. They would send out homing signals through flashing of a certain frequency in order to retrieve the meka, which they would then release again following maintenance and examination. Over time, certain individuals began to use this flashing method as a type of \"bait\" to catch these meka, and it is now widely known among the angling community.",

As a result, they can be attracted by certain types of bait and are occasionally caught by anglers, who refer to them as \"Water Maintenance Fish\" or \"Iron Fish.\"\nUnder certain conditions, Maintenance Meks will treat the food of some underwater creatures as targets to be cleaned, and thus sometimes find themselves embroiled in conflicts in which they are at a disadvantage due to their small size and lack of power. Over time, an increasing number were being damaged as a result. \nTo protect the previous two models and ensure safe cleaning, researchers utilized existent frameworks and did their best to increase the power density of core structures. In the end, they developed a third model with certain combat capabilities, which was primarily designed to drive away underwater creatures by ramming into them. The new model was rapidly manufactured on the basis of previous processes.\nHowever, the plan to further enhance \"Situation Controllers\" was suddenly terminated by the Fontaine Research Institute. After all, if these little things were capable of driving ferocious underwater creatures away, then what were all the other underwater meka for? In reality, these \"Situation Controllers\" were of no real use against the underwater creatures that actually posed a threat to the other meka, and could only deal with common fishes and damage the ecosystem. As a result, researchers had to shut down some of them intentionally and restrict their offensive capabilities.",

    "Description": "Compact assistance meka developed to increase the overall utilization rates of meka teams, providing aid for underwater projects. They were originally designed to remove junk, vegetation, and other underwater debris in order to prevent these from clogging up the vital parts of other clockwork meka, thereby minimizing failure rates.\nCompared to the other batch-produced models, these special limited-edition \"Platinum Collection\" meks stand out with their clean and bright casing. When trying to attract support from wealthy merchants for the Maintenance Mek project, the development team would send them a fish tank containing one of these exquisite contraptions as a gift – and fine gifts they were indeed! Unfortunately, none of these attempts worked, so the development team adjusted their plans and tried to sell them off as toys to make up for the lack of project funds instead.\nIn the end, due to the accident that we all remember, the whole development team was dismissed and all of their future projects were canceled. At present, all of the remaining Maintenance Meks in Fontaine are totally unsupervised, and the \"Platinum Collection\" batch are no exception – they have all been lost to the water. Disappearing completely off the radar, they have turned out to be the most unique and expensive \"fishes\" in Fontaine. According to an in-depth investigation and cross-examination of the existing data by journalists of The Steambird, \"the deployment of Maintenance Meks has not made any significant difference to the pollution levels of Fontaine's waters, and the effect of the project is still in question.\" Nowadays, surviving \"Platinum Collection\" meks still wander the waters of Fontaine, and they are considered among the most prized of catches. After all, a \"Platinum Collection\" mek is now as rare as the most valuable Ornamental Fish in other nations.",
