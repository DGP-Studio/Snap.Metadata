As a result, while their features were perfected during the course of its development, the Artificed Dancers gradually strayed from Bossuet's original vision.",

    "Description": "A large device designed by the late Edwin Eastinghouse. It has the ability to \"counteract\" the effects of gravity. According to the original design intentions, this was the first step in a plan to turn Fontaine into a city in the sky, so never again would the people have to worry about the waves that once swept over the land. Even if all seven nations were to be swallowed by the deeps, the elegant Court of Fontaine would float above it all, just like Celestia. Even the secrets of the universe would no longer seem so distant.\nThe Arkhium in the device's core has the characteristics of \"splitting\" or \"precipitation,\" and can take matter, or certain things outside of matter, and separate them. It is said that this process can be reversed, but the Fontaine Research Institute is infatuated only with the physical effects it can produce.",

In the \"Song of Dobharcu,\" the writer describes the outcome of the war: the great Hunter's Ray known as the Stormlord stirred huge waves in its death throes, causing what is now known by the people as the \"first diluvian period\"...\nOf course, all of this is nothing more than the romantic imaginations of people who are unwilling to accept the bland realities of the world. For the Fontemer Aberrants are in fact just simple aquatic animals, and they have no grand courts nor fallen kingdoms, nor do they possess words meant to exalt or curse.",

    "Description": "This is the form that the puppet that inherited the Raiden Shogun's authority takes when she is opposing those who threaten Eternity.\nAs the Raiden Shogun's assistant in pursuing eternity, she has never doubted, never felt fear, never given anything less than her best, never been disturbed by idle thoughts.\nShe once heard about how Ei had shouldered a similar duty when Makoto was also present, suffering much agonizing loss in the process.\nWhen the two shadows overlapped once more, however, she could only see the countless fine fractures in what should have been \"her\" eternal will. Since fate is destined for cyclicality, she must fulfill her promise and declare war on \"her.\"\n\n<i>Mine is the most supreme and noble form. Power over the realm has been vested within me, and I am the essence of all that is the \"Raiden Shogun.\"</i>\n<i>\"Naturally, I have also inherited the pain of Ei's countless losses and her will to attain Eternity.</i>\n<i>\"Resolve, valor, love, hate... They will all twist in the river of time.</i>\n<i>\"But the 'rules' will never change.\"</i>",

    "Description": "Apep walked through the water like a fish with its many offspring in a sea of fragrant grass, gigantic trees, and unimaginably long vines. Finally, the grass, trees, and vines withered and turned into dust, while countless beings as minute as grains of gravel built a fragile kingdom upon Apep's land.\nApep and its offspring let the sea of sand rage like boiling water and swept houses down as if they were falling leaves. Until the day when the new Lord of Sand reconciled with the king who lost their homeland, the dunes under the sun belonged to humanity, while the dragon's oasis remained in the hearts of the dragons.\nApep shared the knowledge of evolution with its many offspring, because spreading knowledge ensures dissemination while the stagnation of hoarded wisdom courted only decay. Till the day the promise between it and the Lord of Sand was finally attained, with ultimate wisdom claimed. Henceforth, it reaped only sights of oblivion, of an endless calamity.\nApep found itself swallowed alone amidst the scenery of the catastrophe. All the people, gods, dragons, beasts, birds, and fish. All memories, wisdom, words, and hatred were ground into colorless dust, and the last of the moonlight burned away into a rain of pale fire, falling on the barren land.\n...\nApep once deemed the bottom of the sea of sand to be its grave, not the palace of a dispossessed king. The poison of \"wisdom\" would soon free Apep from the hatred and anger festering within it over countless moons. Apep had grown weary of the colorless apocalypse. Then, finally, the young god and the golden Traveler let it recall once again, even though the verdant land it once ruled had been reduced to this gilded wasteland, even though Apep and its many offspring had grown twisted and wretched to secure their continued survival therein, Apep still treasured the sight and scenes of the oasis, sparkling in its heart.",
