But the view in this realm is so stunningly beautiful that one could admire it all night long. So, to avoid encouraging heavy drinkers to spend all night drinking in the pavilion, Tubby has taken the liberty of removing the table.",

When people who greatly respected the Yoriki came forward to pay their respects, the orioles were gone, and the blood-red rockery they left behind was named the \"Weeping Stone.\"",

Its water cannon projectiles are slower and smaller than those of its ordinary counterparts, but the power of such attacks is undiminished due to the incredibly bitter pheromones within. During their courtship phase, an observer might bear witness to the curious sight of males and females of this species blasting each other with these water cannons. Perhaps passing on the bitterness of life is also a manifestation of love.",

They were originally designed to remove junk, vegetation, and other underwater debris in order to prevent these from clogging up the vital parts of other clockwork meka, thereby minimizing failure rates.\nCompared to the other batch-produced models, these special limited-edition \"Platinum Collection\" meks stand out with their clean and bright casing. When trying to attract support from wealthy merchants for the Maintenance Mek project, the development team would send them a fish tank containing one of these exquisite contraptions as a gift — and fine gifts they were indeed! Unfortunately, none of these attempts worked, so the development team adjusted their plans and tried to sell them off as toys to make up for the lack of project funds instead.\nIn the end, due to the accident that we all remember, the whole development team was dismissed and all of their future projects were canceled. At present, all of the remaining Maintenance Meks in Fontaine are totally unsupervised, and the \"Platinum Collection\" batch are no exception — they have all been lost to the water. Disappearing completely off the radar, they have turned out to be the most unique and expensive \"fishes\" in Fontaine. According to an in-depth investigation and cross-examination of the existing data by journalists of The Steambird, \"the deployment of Maintenance Meks has not made any significant difference to the pollution levels of Fontaine's waters, and the effect of the project is still in question.\" Nowadays, surviving \"Platinum Collection\" meks still wander the waters of Fontaine, and they are considered among the most prized of catches. After all, a \"Platinum Collection\" mek is now as rare as the most valuable Ornamental Fish in other nations.",

Actually, there really is a balloon-like swim bladder in there.\nWhile the Phony Phlogiston Unihornfish can provide graffiti enthusiasts with precious paints, they can only live in liquid phlogiston environments. Thus, the Graffiti Alliance began to explore raising this kind of fish in ordinary aqueous environments. To accomplish this, the previous Graffiti Alliance's leader's previous predecessor began to work with the Natlan Fishing Association, expending an enormous sum to import clockwork fish from Fontaine, using \"Maintenance Mek\" tech to build an ecological simulation mek with onboard data collection capabilities and conduct extensive observations and research. Alas, the results were most disappointing: the horn-like crystal structures on Unihornfish heads ceased to shine with flame-like light after the fish left their liquid phlogiston environment, and so, the plan ended in failure.\nFortunately, due to the way their dorsal fin extends above the water while they swim, these mek Unihornfish look kind of like sharks from a distance. Thanks to this, the People of the Springs ended up buying an appropriate quantity of these \"Pseudoshark Unihornfish\" from the Graffiti Alliance and Natlan Fishing Association.

If even the Police Station had to be walled and fenced all-around with a double guard all year round, then would this not indicate that Inazuma City's security at large was woefully lacking? On the other hand, should the fences be open on all sides, even seeming nigh defenseless, the people would have confidence that the city's security was well in hand. I mean, there's no way the walls could have been constructed this way due to an oversight... Right?",

These carts tend to be made from hastily-modified Otogi Wood, while the grain sacks have been tightly bound.\nThe old farmers of Inazuma have a secret trick to storing grain: they oven-dry Lavender Melon skin and grind it into powder before adding tea powder, stir-frying them both, and pouring the lot to mix with grain. This helps to prevent pests and mildew from setting in. However, the aforementioned method does give any grain so processed a rather strange smell, and it is for that reason that such methods are rarely used anymore.",

Its roofing is quite gently sloped and is enjoined to one wall, which can make it seem a little odd, but there is a special consideration at play here — for shots fired from long or middling range, the silhouettes of such barracks are quite small, thus making them less likely to be hit. Even when they are hit, there is a good chance that the projectiles will bounce off the sloped roof. The wood on the roof has been specially treated such that it does not ignite easily, thus effectively invalidating fire-based tactics. The weaknesses of this design, however, are the sizable sacrifices made to interior space and therefore comfort.",

These balms also tend to be a good deal cheaper than entire scented candles, which are uncommon in Inazuma anyway.",

Of course, some high-class paints do use traditional flowers as their base material. The source of the latter comes from items such as underwater colored stone and fish scales. There is no real difference in the price ranges of the two different types. Instead, the artist will choose between the two styles based on their understanding of the work they are doing.

These suits of armor still follow the classic forms used by hatamoto a century ago and are widely used by the Tenryou Commission, both for combat and ceremony.\nIn a time before armor-making materials experienced a renaissance, the protective power of armor was balanced on a scale against its weight. Heavier armor provided more protection, yes, but it was a huge drain on the wearer's stamina and could not be put on quickly.\nThe Shogun's army, equipped with such sturdy armor, was able to achieve battlefield superiority against the resistance for a time. Unfortunately, the samurai could not wear their armor indefinitely, and the resistance leadership caught on to the weaknesses in reaction and preparation time that these suits of armor imposed, engaging them with multiple forces on different fronts and using harassing tactics that forced the Shogunate forces many times into battles where there was no time to put their armor on. Subsequently, the Shogun's army also gradually switched to using lighter gear that allowed them to react quickly and engage the enemy flexibly.",

Can be used to build a Puffy Snowman.\nSnowmen built near Dragonspine will sometimes be taken for enemies by Forest Boars who will charge and destroy them, much to the consternation of the children. In the process of this battle of wits, some children have chosen hard stones to use in making the snowmen's noses. This way, boars that charge them would get a face-full of stone for their trouble. This ultimately worked: Forest Boars today no longer charge snowmen with the impunity of yesteryear.",

According to Tubby, a certain adepti with black hair and golden eyes wanted to temporarily change the melody echoing in the Realm Within to match the aesthetic of the tea on the table when he was having a small gathering with his friends in the Realm Within. Ping then combined the characteristics of various musical instruments to create these wonderful furnishings to control the rhythm in the cave in the pot and imparted these skills to Tubby. These two \"Euphonium Unbound\" furnishings are Tubby's masterpieces, which not only reproduce the music of those days but also interpret the melodies hidden in certain special objects.",

If the flooring of the city remains sound for long periods of times, then this means that the road ahead will be smooth and without impediments. As such, maintenance of the ground is of utmost importance. The Lantern Rite and other such important festivals are often held in venues with this type of flooring.",

The Practice Stakes can be placed anywhere within a limited area and will persist once placed. You can initiate the Practice Challenge at any time. If you can destroy all the wooden stakes in 2s, the challenge will be considered a success.\n Interact with the Practice Plaque to check your records. After hearing the Traveler describe the training methods of certain adventurers, Tubby made this furniture combination for the Traveler to go a few rounds. After all, life in the Realm Within is very comfortable, and if you stay idle for too long, your fighting skills may slowly become rusty. Breaking multiple stakes is indeed easy, but if the stakes are spaced as far apart as possible, it is also a challenge to test one's speed and skill.\nAim for \"breaking a large number of targets in a short period of time\" and start your training with ease.",

After interacting with the Seeker's Board, you can begin a treasure hunt or view hunt records. The Confuzzled Tubbers can be freely placed within a set space, where they will continuously remain. You can combine these placements with pre-existing furnishings within the Serenitea Pot to hide the Tubbers, after which you will have to search for these Tubbers within a time limit.\nAfter hearing about Mondstadt's traditional game, Windtrace, from the Traveler, Tubby also resolved to create a game based around hide-and-seek, thus creating this particular furnishing combination. However, such a game that only involved Tubby, the Traveler, and Paimon would have too few people and thus lack a certain fun factor. As such, Tubby created many \"Confuzzled Tubber\" toys to play the role of other participants. Tubby even suggested that the Traveler could use adeptal energies to create playing fields and invite friends to come and experience the fun together.\nIt seems that Tubby shares senses with the Confuzzled Tubbers, which can allow her to drink tea in peace within her teacup while enjoying the games.\nNot that this has anything to do with Tubby growing both tubbier and lazier lately, of course.",

The structure and flooring are made from high-quality Fragrant Cedar Wood with meticulous workmanship, but thanks to the clever design, it is easy to set up and maintain, and can be transferred to other performance venues with less manpower. The circular design facilitates the arrangement of the guest seats, allowing each guest to maintain the best distance from the stage for a wonderful opera-listening experience.\nIt is said that Yun-Han Opera Troupe built two stages: one for performances and one for practice and rehearsals. Yun Jin spends the majority of her time practicing on this stage, so much so that veteran artists can even find the shoe prints left behind by Yun Jin's tireless efforts at certain spots of the stage.",

Some festivals and performances are also held in squares paved with such stone tiles.",

For display purposes, however, the rings are locked and will not rotate. It is said that the reason for this modification was the predilection of some to enjoy watching the rings spinning at high speeds, which has resulted in some accidents, such as the structure collapsing, sending the rings flying out to hit and injure a cat on the roof...\nAs such, a \"safety first\" approach was adopted with regard to this furnishing.",

Word has it that a certain senior angler spent a fortune on the tank so as to better appreciate the magnificent fish he had caught. Experts were specially hired to design the tank, the making of which even utilized Fontaine's most advanced technologies to fashion the tank out of a single piece of glass. Two pieces of curved glass bent at different angles were then used to form the sides of the fish tank, such that the size of the fish inside might be optically shrunk, allowing onlookers to move their eyes less when admiring his beloved fish.\nIt's just that such large pieces of glass are of fairly limited strength. Therefore, it would be unwise to tamper with the irritable kinds inside the fish tank, such as Betta, or else you will probably have to spend the whole day rescuing the dying fish, picking up glass shards, and cleaning up the floor.",

With the help of Canned Knowledge, she was able to impart secret new ways of processing clay to the potters in town while stipulating the suggested retail price of glazed pottery in her agreements, which would also earn her a fair sum for each piece successfully sold. Only within a few years, she defeated all her competitors utterly and made a huge fortune out of this, all while making glazed pottery much more available to ordinary households. The whole affair went on so quietly that even to this day, the merchants who used to sell glazed pottery as luxury items cannot figure out where went wrong. From their points of view, the potters all \"suddenly received guidance from an expert and disrupted the pottery market once and for all.\"\nYet, as impressive as these machinations sound, the traveling merchant herself seems to almost forget about this.

Hence, they spent a fortune purchasing the technical know-how behind Liyue-style porcelain, which later took Sumeru pottery into a brand new era. Of course, the pottery pieces made with such techniques were branded as imported luxury items by these merchants.

Once, a self-claimed \"senior\" researcher in machinery even had an intense academic argument with an architecture researcher over a related discussion in front of a textile stall.

    "Description": "A workstation made from high-quality Brightwood, it looks like an ordinary table with an intricate mechanism underneath. Its internal structure is quite similar to clockwork. Simply turning the mechanism will allow one to store energy within the desk. This energy powers the rotation of the turntable, facilitating the pottery-making process. It is said that this particular design was inspired by similar products in Liyue that were then adapted by researchers to Sumeru's local conditions, arts, and materials. When this workstation became popular, Sumeru's earthenware production capacity also greatly increased.",

One noticeable feature of Sumeru fairy tales — indeed, of Sumeru tales in general — is the combination of storytelling with singing. Therefore, storytellers from Sumeru are often talented singers. There are many singing Aranara in these stories, too. Some are soloists, while others form choruses, and their songs are ever so delicately interwoven with melodies that have been passed down since ancient times.",

However, a group of Treasure Hoarders once set up crossbowmen at the negotiation site in an attempt to hurt and kidnap an important member of the Eremites for ransom. Fortunately, a sellsword with long black and gold hair was also at the scene. Seeing through the trap, she kicked down the long table and used it as protection. The Treasure Hoarders had spent all their arrows, but they failed to penetrate the table, and the Eremite member was barely scratched. In the end, the Treasure Hoarders all retreated in surprise. Since then, people have been more confident that the long table can withstand arrows.",

Smoking, waxing, and other processes will increase the planks' hardness to their greatest extent, before mortise and tenon structures are used to join them together. They are then affixed on three relatively light and soft backplanes to form a double-layer composite structure, which tries to wear down incoming blades and arrows to the greatest extent possible, weakening their power and absorbing their impact. At the same time, the frame is covered with a rigid iron structure, while reinforcing structures are placed at the vertex of the shield arc to resist the impact of blunt objects and opposing shields — and with that, the shield is complete.\nSuch shields are said to be able to fend off any attack from anyone without a Vision. Their price is also equivalent to dozens of ordinary weapons, which limits their users to small numbers of Eremite or Corps of Thirty elite troops.\nTreasure Hoarders, who prioritize the lightness of their equipment, can't comprehend why a sellsword would invest so much in a shield like this. Only a select few frontline mercenaries and the designer of this shield type understand the importance of such equipment. As a reckless youth, the shield designer once led an incursion into Aaru Village in search of his colleagues' nemesis, only to be defeated by a young guard.

Such drapes are some of the finer products that are exchanged for other goods with Caravan Ribat's merchants.\nResearchers staying in Caravan Ribat noticed the material's endurance and thus incorporated desert plants into their plant fiber research.",

However, they cannot be produced in large quantities and are therefore not for sale. The drapes were originally designed by an old artisan, who in their last days sought to pour all their life's experience into this piece of experimental work. As such, it ended up on a wall in the village chief's house — as a memento and also a source of inspiration for young artisans. In spite of the scorching heat in the desert, one can always find a sweet pool of water inside their heart so long as they do not give up aiming higher.",

As such, Cyno often takes advantage of this notion by going out empty-handed and acting like he's not working, which can catch his targets off guard, or by taking the briefcase to the tavern to sit at a table for a long game of Genius Invokation TCG until any onlookers tire of watching him. With time, the briefcase has thus come to symbolize the \"unpredictable work hours of the General Mahamatra.\"",

For if one buys fully ripened Zaytun Peaches from Caravan Ribat, they would have already lost most of their moisture to the hot weather by the time they get to Aaru Village — indeed, they might even have rotted by then.\nAs such, the villagers and the caravan merchants came together to think of a storage solution — first, they would wash as-yet unripe Peaches and scatter some specially-blended spices over them, before allowing them to soak inside barrels of wine. This way, all that is needed will be to bring the Zaytun Peaches back to Aaru Village before leaving them be for a while until the light alcohol on the surface volatilizes, thus giving the fruits a texture almost identical to what they would have had if freshly-picked and ripe. And if eaten the moment they are taken out from the wine barrel, one will get a uniquely crisp and refreshing flavor — a true Aaru Village special found nowhere else.",

However, this standard is no longer considered suitable when it becomes to buildings created in recent times, for a certain girl with two differently-colored eyes has joined the ranks of the guards.

But during such times, Sumpter Beasts do also use their bodies to block the sunlight for these merchants, thus providing a measure of shade.",

Whenever she passed the Wall of Samiel's gate in her ragged state, she would often find a golden leaf of a certain plant caught in her luggage or her hair. This gold frightened her a little, for if the sky was akin to the color of these leaves, that could only mean that the sunlight this day would be exceedingly strong — torment indeed for those who lacked physical strength yet still had to trek through the desert. Such was her fear that she would subconsciously walk around any such plants of this kind that she might pass by.",

If one wishes to experience the world through the eyes of a 'Ruin Drake: Skywatch,' perhaps one might consider jumping atop some of these plants.\"\nThe latest edition of the matra manual has this to say concerning this species of desert shrub.\nLike the discussion about the incense, this description also doesn't seem to have any practical impact on operations. Some matra did try the instructions out for themselves, eventually concluding that \"these plants aren't half bad as cushions\" — save for the one person who tried stepping on this cushion 20,003 times, the final time upon which it exploded, sending that person flying into the air.\nOne day, one young subordinate, unable to contain their curiosity, brought a heavily-annotated manual to the General Mahamatra with the following two questions: \"which botanist did you ask to help with the manual?\" and \"what is the deeper meaning behind some of these seemingly simple and relaxed descriptions?\"\nAt this time, the General Mahamatra was in Gandharva Ville talking to a certain Forest Watcher with long upright ears. Hearing those questions, he finished his meal before telling two jokes that were no different from his usual fare with a completely straight face, leaving his young subordinate stunned for quite a while. Seeing their confusion, the General Mahamatra seemed ready to give a yet more detailed explanation, only for the Forest Watcher to quickly speak up, saying that \"You see, he just needs to write a few things to adjust the mood a bit. If you didn't understand what was being said, then it wasn't that important. And if you didn't find those descriptions funny, then there's no need to remember them!\"\nEnding the conversation hastily, this young subordinate would keep the Forest Watcher's words firmly in mind, and even shared them with their colleagues. Unfortunately, it seems that even today, these poor matra still have not yet fully understood the meaning of those words.",

All cargo ships entering Port Ormos are unloaded using this crane.\nIn the last hundred years or so, Kshahrewar researchers have been attempting to popularize the use of construction machinery, and this crane was one result of their project. While increasing its lifting efficiency, the crane also takes up very little space and shares many foundational components with other structures in the area. Therefore, it doesn't require a specialized technician to repair, which greatly lowers its construction and maintenance costs. Moreover, these cranes allow Port Ormos to accommodate a higher volume of cargo influx through an increased deployment rate while keeping the budget unchanged.",

One can even shave a whole digit off the price this way.\nUnfortunately, such events do not have fixed dates, and merchants and taverns usually run only one such promotion every month, so you have to watch for when such things might happen. It is said that there is a blond-haired guest who has managed to catch the discount every time, thus sparking a certain rumor amongst tavern patrons: If you see a blond-haired customer appearing near the tavern with a basket of wine, it means that the time for discounts has come!",

Although the main support structure of this round table is in the middle, it will never have trouble remaining stable no matter how worn it is. This is thanks to Margaret, the owner of the tavern, having stressed the various use cases of such tables while speaking to the craftspeople. For example, it has to be able to withstand a heavy fall by someone defeated in a TCG match, or the slam of hands on the table by drunk customers tickled pink by a friend's humor... And most importantly of all, it has to be able to hold the bulk of The Cat's Tail's collection of rather sturdy feline specimens as they leap from table to floor to table, and survive any incidental impacts that might occur as they play. As for the high costs that came with the reinforcement of the tables' central structures... Well, so long as the cats are happy, there's no price too high!",

The exterior wall is made of beautiful and economic light yellow bricks that are produced from processed Tearstone. The main frame of the building is made from Cypress Wood supplemented with slag cement, a new material developed by the Fontaine Research Institute before the incident, giving it a very long lifespan.\nThe Fontaine Research Institute was researching a unique method of construction — using a metal frame and cement to create a new wood-free building. These buildings would remain standing even if the Emperor of Fire and Iron caused a ruckus on the roof. However, Fontaine lacks the resources to produce the requisite quantities of metal with high enough load-bearing strength. For this reason, mass production of things such as clockwork meka was given priority for Fontaine's metallurgic resources. In light of this, construction with a metal frame and slag cement has not gained widespread popularity.",

It's one of the few buildings to utilize the metal frame and slag cement construction method, and even the gaps between the masonry are filled with a powerful adhesive. It is said that even a berserk clockwork meka going all out would have a hard time tearing it down.\nAccording to a certain tabloid, when the Adventurers' Guild built its Fontaine branch, they took the possibility of repeated inspections by the Maison Gardiennage and the huge pressure the heavy clockwork meka would exert on the flooring into consideration. Furthermore, if conflict were to rise with the Maison Gardiennage or if a clockwork meka were to go out of control, half the building could easily be destroyed. Thus, the Adventurers' Guild was willing to invest a huge sum in a strong structure utilizing a metal frame.\nWhen asked about it, the members of the Adventurers' Guild refused to comment on this or just responded with blank expressions. However, the local residents could clearly tell the relationship between the Adventurers' Guild and Maison Gardiennage was quite harmonious, nor was the building designed especially for the Adventurers' Guild. The article was seen as fabricating and spreading rumors. As a result, the author of the article soon became a pariah in Fontaine media industry.",

The residue and gas emission from smelting is processed multiple times to remove all harmful substances for reuse in the production of slag cement — a common construction material in Fontaine.

Lepaute Horlogerie made full use of the building's piping to hang an exquisite, large watch face on the central pillar of the outer wall.\nFrom the outside, this building appears slightly larger than the other stores in Quartier Lyonnais. However, from the beginning it had an integrated design with an anti-earthquake foundation, which was shaped like a bathtub and laid with slag cement. Additionally, both internal and external gaps were filled with shock-absorbing materials like Mallow Tree leaves and Seagrass. This prevents vibrations from things like clockwork meka and passing freight trailers from disturbing the personnel delicately constructing the exquisitely designed clockwork devices within. While most people would find such vibrations almost impossible to perceive, they can cause inaccuracies in an intricate mechanism like a timepiece. Therefore, preventive measures are necessary...",

The famous Café Lutece combines this design with an open air patio, creating a space where customers can enjoy the coffee outside, surrounded by its aroma. It is said that construction costs in Vasari Passage are relatively low due to the use of improved slag cement. Slag cement normally contains trace amounts of a smell reminiscent of powdered ore. While it may go unnoticed by the ordinary person, for those in the catering industry, it is highly detrimental to the long-term storage of goods. Thanks to the strict aromatic standards of a previous owner of Café Lutece, and with the help of The Steambird and protests from many others in the industry throughout the city, researchers dared not ignore the issue and began researching an improved formula that removed the lingering odor. As a result, some coffee enthusiasts have nicknamed the latest generation of slag cement \"Coffee Ground Cement.\"",

It is a product of early forays into modular architecture, and an example given in the Court of Fontaine Standards for Exterior Wall Decorations. Once construction using slag cement matured, architects believed rapid assembly of houses on a large scale was possible by making all the load-bearing walls in advance and using large clockwork meka to assist in construction.\nHowever, despite many attempts to adjust the coloration, an icy cold and gloomy gray were the only possible outcomes for slag cement. Housing and indoor architecture would be far too plain if built like that, and so light yellow bricks are still necessary for the exterior wall panels while tiles or wood flooring are required indoors. Thus, concerns about aesthetics and livability won out over the time savings promised by modular construction. Thus, the architects turned to another form of modular construction design that focused on structure and reserving space for internal piping.\nOf course, even if the architects succeed, there may not be much demand in Fontaine unless the Fontaine Research Institute is rebuilt — which is another complicated issue in itself...",

Its well-divided internal space can provide long-term accommodation for five to six single residents. Although its appearance is extremely plain, this building was actually one of the first to use the mature form of slag cement in its construction.\nAccording to legend, the craftspeople of Fontaine attempted to promote Tearstone construction throughout Fontaine after the completion of the Opera Epiclese. Unfortunately, the extremely high costs that came with Tearstone were beyond the means of most Fontainians.\nSo, they found a project team at the Fontaine Research Institute and requested the development of a construction material with similar strength to Tearstone that would be affordable for the general public. The researchers traveled in search of inspiration and finally found it in the process of smelting. They set out to design a \"stone\" that solidifies from a liquid form, and after decades of trial and error, they finally invented a cheap and resource-efficient material — slag cement.",

The clockwork meka used can only follow commands and repeat the production process, with no one to verify the final results of the dyeing process. The workers assembling the awnings afterward just followed their instructions and also failed to notice the color issue. When the designer finally saw the finished product, such a large quantity had already been produced as to making scrapping the project unfeasible. After making sure there were no quality issues, they were sold normally.\nThis case became the subject of a paper from a certain research team at the Fontaine Research Institute, and subsequently became a key argument for the necessity of human supervision in clockwork meka-assisted production.",

Its aquamarine blooms resemble fluttering butterflies when viewed from the side.\nDefining colors and studying the properties of light is the responsibility of a research group at the Fontaine Research Institute. Its researchers often engaged in prolonged debates with painters and photographers about the definitions of aquamarine and oceanic blue. The debate caused delays in other projects, eventually resulting in a compromise in which the definition of colors within the blue spectrum were significantly broadened. It serves as a reminder to newcomers that getting too caught up in trivial semantic debates is a waste of time.",

From another point of view, they are undoubtedly benefiting Fontaine's ecosystem greatly as underwater cleaners.\nLegend has it that when maintenance meks were initially deployed, researchers made various demos to prove the technology for organizations like the Fishing Association, providing demo types along with instruction manuals. This was to explain the origin and features of this fish-shaped meka to the people of Fontaine, ensuring people wouldn't be confused or harmed when seeing them. However, the aggressiveness of the meka was overestimated, and the skill of the anglers underrated. With the disbandment of the maintenance project team, these technical demo meka are but decorations, offering a glimpse into the intriguing technological development of Fontaine.",

Following the principle of \"establishing a semblance of order no matter what,\" the Palais Mermonia made revisions to city ordinances, regulating the locations and manner in which such boards could appear.\n...But when they were done, and announced the measures to the public, they found that the phenomenon then significantly decreased throughout the Court.

However, this proved ineffective, as most people on the streets were in a hurry and uneager to accept some mysterious piece of paper thrust upon them by a stranger, never mind read it carefully. But just as everyone was at a loss, some promoters noticed that pedestrians sitting on benches were more inclined to read newspapers voluntarily. Therefore, they proposed that newspapers should not be forcibly handed to busy passersby, but should be placed in fixed facilities for people to read at leisure. The book and newspaper racks now scattered throughout the streets and alleys of Fontaine are the concrete realization of that brainwave.",

Therefore, the administrators of Fontaine arranged for specialists to study the key points of the \"rapid classification of news article themes,\" with the result being this three-layer book and newspaper reading shelf. They also adopted the latest classification principle: the most prominent place belongs to The Steambird and its subsidiaries, while other spots are freely allocated according to demand.

When in use, the relevant goods could be placed directly under it to then be lifted.\nHowever, the load-bearing capacity of the door frame could not meet the lifting requirements, and its loading and unloading efficiency proved unsatisfactory. The rate at which the device rusted when exposed to moisture for prolonged periods also exceeded initial expectations, with the potential for additional maintenance costs to arise in the future...\nTaking these various factors into account, the residents of Poisson decided to ask the overly confident engineer to leave after settling the payment.\nThe manufactured prototypes were not directly discarded, however. Instead, the townspeople repurposed them into public amenities.",

    "Description": "A shrub cultivated by Fontainian gardeners that has a lovely shape and an enticing fragrance. Perhaps it was the vibrant shade or its striking scent, but a local tabloid once confidently claimed that they contained a certain slow-acting poison. According to that tabloid, people who lingered near these flowers for too long might experience physical issues such as insomnia, irritability, and swollen and painful eyes. After some time, another obscure tabloid asserted that a famous opera singer regularly consumed flower tea made from these flowers, this being the secret to the star's lasting youth.\nFor a time, there was heated debate amongst some Fontainians about these flowers and the relevant departments of the Palais Mermonia responsible for the city's landscaping. Some actively avoided these flowers, while others secretly wanted to take some home to cultivate them...\nWith few other options, the Palais had to invite a specialist in botany to write a seven-day editorial series on The Steambird, clearing up all the falsehoods and emphasizing that this type of flower was just ornamental, and had no other deeper impact on residents' lives apart from the lifting of their spirits.\nNowadays, these purple flowers also adorn the area before the Opera Epiclese's gates, and the rocky period these flowers underwent has long passed, thanks to the efforts of various parties.\nHowever, some novelists drew great inspiration from this particular farce. These folk with their fine humor wrote a series of related short-form novels on the theme of \"perilous flowers,\" with a particularly popular one being \"Peaceful Day Nine,\" which featured poisonous flowers as a means of committing a devious crime, and mentioned that the original form of the dangerous plant was that very same controversial shrub from before.\nTo avoid causing the same trouble as before, the author emphasized the following at the start of said story:\n\"This is entirely a work of fiction!\"\n\"...Nonetheless, the author is not encouraging you or your family members to consume this flower.\"",

To dispel such concerns, Chunming Teaworks will deliberately weigh the weight of each batch of tea leaves before and after drying and roasting, recording it on storage labels for easy verification. Aside from the experienced tea craftsmen who have been roasting tea for many years, not many can derive much information from such records. Still, the detailed data is symbolic of a rigorous attitude and an important process that cannot be neglected, as it leaves customers who purchase tea leaves doubly reassured.",

This unique design feature allows the buildings to provide massive amounts of kinetic energy even with limited space, allowing them to drive complex systems of gears and tracks. This has made them an ideal choice for both expanding the available vertical space while providing auxiliary energy.\nLegend holds that a resident of Constellation Metropole once discovered by chance that if you look at the building from a certain angle, the profile of the building looks like a musician playing a trumpet. For this reason, they bestowed the moniker \"the Trumpeter\" on this building, and thenceforth, this imaginative name spread throughout some of the citizenry of Constellation Metropole.",

Nothing else would fit the primordial ecosystem aesthetic.\" This point of view is quite popular among certain circles in Constellation Metropole.

Apparently, most of these buildings are equipped with two doors of different sizes: a larger front door for walking in and out, and a smaller back door for easier handling of goods. However, in practice, many people use the smaller door as a window for aerial access, while some even open the large door outward to aid in flight. Of course, such unsafe practices are not endorsed by the chief, and if attempted in defiance of the rules, may even result in the loss of flight privileges...",

It is said that, while the Scions of the Canopy view their buildings as \"camps for exploration,\" the Flower-Feather Clan sees theirs as \"bases for combat and training.\" As such, their buildings are designed with a double-layered structure similar to a balloon. The outer fabric is made of fabric that maintains the shape, while internal air pockets provide additional buoyancy. This design reduces the weight burden on wooden platforms and allows the houses to be quickly transformed into balloons, augmenting their aerial capabilities in times of war.",

For fully grown Qucusaurs, however, the door presents no obstacle — they can easily leap over it in or out, just as effortlessly as people come and go from their homes.",

Unlike platforms and walkways, which can increase redundancy by being suspended or equipped with balloons underneath to extend their lifespan, stairs typically can only reduce maintenance costs by minimizing weight. Therefore, the Flower-Feather Clan use extremely lightweight wooden stairs.

Not only is it exceptionally sturdy, it also offers unparalleled soundproofing and insulation — ideal for private spaces. The graffiti on the door is made using specialized phlogiston-based paints, not only extending its lifespan but also providing anti-stain and even mood-enhancing benefits.\nThat being said, given that they are made from stone, these doors require considerable strength to operate and maintain. Slighter individuals, as well those for whom physical strength is not their forte, may want to think carefully before installing such doors...",

Given the solemn reverence called for by both such moments, these entryways were elaborately decorated to pay homage to the warriors' valor. This tradition endures even to this day, and as a result, the entrances to Natlan-style courtyards are still renowned for their dignified and sacred aura.",

Some believe it derives from its striking blue leaves, which immediately calls to mind the ocean's endless waves. Others, however, argue that it is because the oil of its fruit is ideal for maintaining surfboards. If you were to take a stroll around the People of the Springs, you would soon notice that many of their surfboards give off its distinctive fragrance — and it is this, they say, that first led people to make this association with the waves.",
