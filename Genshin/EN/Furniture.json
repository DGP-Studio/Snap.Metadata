In just nine steps, a creative idea will drop into their mind like a falling Sakura blossom. This is how the tall Sakura Tree earned its name of \"Between Nine Steps.\"",

But one day, the Yoriki received a letter from afar, and upon reading it, he threw on his armor, took up his sword, and left in a hurry. The orioles would await the Yoriki's return upon the rockery outside the house for many days, but he never returned, and they knew not his fate until a friend came by one day to pack up his belongings — only then did they learn that he had departed to hunt the Tatarigami, but had been slain on the front lines.\nFrom that day forth, the orioles would weep blood, and their tears would stain the rockery red. When people who greatly respected the Yoriki came forward to pay their respects, the orioles were gone, and the blood-red rockery they left behind was named the \"Weeping Stone.\"",

Due to their hard scales and big size, Axe Marlins are able to handle attacks from other aquatic creatures, waiting until their attacker is exhausted and leaves.\nTheir strength can also prove challenging for a master fisherman, whose only choice is to treat them as large beasts — to drain their stamina more efficiently and eventually catch them, one must go all out the moment an Axe Marlin bites.",

Over time, an increasing number were being damaged as a result. \nTo protect the previous two models and ensure safe cleaning, researchers utilized existent frameworks and did their best to increase the power density of core structures. In the end, they developed a third model with certain combat capabilities, which was primarily designed to drive away underwater creatures by ramming into them. The new model was rapidly manufactured on the basis of previous processes.\nHowever, the plan to further enhance \"Situation Controllers\" was suddenly terminated by the Fontaine Research Institute. After all, if these little things were capable of driving ferocious underwater creatures away, then what were all the other underwater meka for? In reality, these \"Situation Controllers\" were of no real use against the underwater creatures that actually posed a threat to the other meka, and could only deal with common fishes and damage the ecosystem. As a result, researchers had to shut down some of them intentionally and restrict their offensive capabilities.",

If even the Police Station had to be walled and fenced all-around with a double guard all year round, then would this not indicate that Inazuma City's security at large was woefully lacking? On the other hand, should the fences be open on all sides, even seeming nigh defenseless, the people would have confidence that the city's security was well in hand. I mean, there's no way the walls could have been constructed this way due to an oversight... Right?",

These carts tend to be made from hastily-modified Otogi Wood, while the grain sacks have been tightly bound.\nThe old farmers of Inazuma have a secret trick to storing grain: they oven-dry Lavender Melon skin and grind it into powder before adding tea powder, stir-frying them both, and pouring the lot to mix with grain. This helps to prevent pests and mildew from setting in. However, the aforementioned method does give any grain so processed a rather strange smell, and it is for that reason that such methods are rarely used anymore.",

Even when they are hit, there is a good chance that the projectiles will bounce off the sloped roof. The wood on the roof has been specially treated such that it does not ignite easily, thus effectively invalidating fire-based tactics. The weaknesses of this design, however, are the sizable sacrifices made to interior space and therefore comfort.",

These balms also tend to be a good deal cheaper than entire scented candles, which are uncommon in Inazuma anyway.",

Of course, some high-class paints do use traditional flowers as their base material. The source of the latter comes from items such as underwater colored stone and fish scales. There is no real difference in the price ranges of the two different types. Instead, the artist will choose between the two styles based on their understanding of the work they are doing.

These suits of armor still follow the classic forms used by hatamoto a century ago and are widely used by the Tenryou Commission, both for combat and ceremony.\nIn a time before armor-making materials experienced a renaissance, the protective power of armor was balanced on a scale against its weight. Heavier armor provided more protection, yes, but it was a huge drain on the wearer's stamina and could not be put on quickly.\nThe Shogun's army, equipped with such sturdy armor, was able to achieve battlefield superiority against the resistance for a time. Unfortunately, the samurai could not wear their armor indefinitely, and the resistance leadership caught on to the weaknesses in reaction and preparation time that these suits of armor imposed, engaging them with multiple forces on different fronts and using harassing tactics that forced the Shogunate forces many times into battles where there was no time to put their armor on. Subsequently, the Shogun's army also gradually switched to using lighter gear that allowed them to react quickly and engage the enemy flexibly.",

Can be used to build a Puffy Snowman.\nSnowmen built near Dragonspine will sometimes be taken for enemies by Forest Boars who will charge and destroy them, much to the consternation of the children. In the process of this battle of wits, some children have chosen hard stones to use in making the snowmen's noses. This way, boars that charge them would get a face-full of stone for their trouble. This ultimately worked: Forest Boars today no longer charge snowmen with the impunity of yesteryear.",

According to Tubby, a certain adepti with black hair and golden eyes wanted to temporarily change the melody echoing in the Realm Within to match the aesthetic of the tea on the table when he was having a small gathering with his friends in the Realm Within. Ping then combined the characteristics of various musical instruments to create these wonderful furnishings to control the rhythm in the cave in the pot and imparted these skills to Tubby. These two \"Euphonium Unbound\" furnishings are Tubby's masterpieces, which not only reproduce the music of those days but also interpret the melodies hidden in certain special objects.",

If the flooring of the city remains sound for long periods of times, then this means that the road ahead will be smooth and without impediments. As such, maintenance of the ground is of utmost importance. The Lantern Rite and other such important festivals are often held in venues with this type of flooring.",

    "Description": "A lovely species of grass that can be found near Sangonomiya Shrine. They grow vigorously when the snow melts in the early spring and are notable amongst people for their \"thrice-dyed crimson\" hue.\nLike another plant species with a pinkish-red color, it is said to be related to the Divine Priestess. Some Watatsumi Islanders believe that each time the Divine Priestess prays for her people, one plant will be transformed to have this coloration by her power. As such, some of them will take the leaves of such plants with them as talismans, carrying them on their persons all the time.",

The Practice Stakes can be placed anywhere within a limited area and will persist once placed. You can initiate the Practice Challenge at any time. If you can destroy all the wooden stakes in 2s, the challenge will be considered a success.\n Interact with the Practice Plaque to check your records. After hearing the Traveler describe the training methods of certain adventurers, Tubby made this furniture combination for the Traveler to go a few rounds. After all, life in the Realm Within is very comfortable, and if you stay idle for too long, your fighting skills may slowly become rusty. Breaking multiple stakes is indeed easy, but if the stakes are spaced as far apart as possible, it is also a challenge to test one's speed and skill.\nAim for \"breaking a large number of targets in a short period of time\" and start your training with ease.",

The scrolls on the display board are the devoted works of \"Mr. Calx,\" and they seem to hide secrets that the craftsmen cannot reproduce.\nThese portraits were once displayed in the \"The Five Kasen\" square of the Irodori Festival, and as the festival progressed, each portrait was revealed one by one, in the order of \"Suikou,\" \"Aoi no Okina,\" \"Akahito,\" \"Sumizome,\" and \"Kuronushi.\" This folding screen, which was brought back by the Traveler as a souvenir to the Realm Within, reveals four of the portraits, recounting the clever intersection of ancient legends and present-day events.",

After interacting with the Seeker's Board, you can begin a treasure hunt or view hunt records. The Confuzzled Tubbers can be freely placed within a set space, where they will continuously remain. You can combine these placements with pre-existing furnishings within the Serenitea Pot to hide the Tubbers, after which you will have to search for these Tubbers within a time limit.\nAfter hearing about Mondstadt's traditional game, Windtrace, from the Traveler, Tubby also resolved to create a game based around hide-and-seek, thus creating this particular furnishing combination. However, such a game that only involved Tubby, the Traveler, and Paimon would have too few people and thus lack a certain fun factor. As such, Tubby created many \"Confuzzled Tubber\" toys to play the role of other participants. Tubby even suggested that the Traveler could use adeptal energies to create playing fields and invite friends to come and experience the fun together.\nIt seems that Tubby shares senses with the Confuzzled Tubbers, which can allow her to drink tea in peace within her teacup while enjoying the games.\nNot that this has anything to do with Tubby growing both tubbier and lazier lately, of course.",

It might even be used for complex time planning or to assist in some special calculations...\nThis device also makes for a lovely table decoration. For display purposes, however, the rings are locked and will not rotate. It is said that the reason for this modification was the predilection of some to enjoy watching the rings spinning at high speeds, which has resulted in some accidents, such as the structure collapsing, sending the rings flying out to hit and injure a cat on the roof...\nAs such, a \"safety first\" approach was adopted with regard to this furnishing.",

As she suspected, everyone did in fact rest under this tent for quite some time, and the gadgets within provided significant entertainment while it rained or the nights grew long.\nAs for the large amount of treasure Klee discovered during the exploration, it took no small amount of effort to bring it all back to Mondstadt. For example, using Cryo to freeze wet ground to better push cargo along, or using Solar Isotoma to lift weights up to cross hilly terrain...

Two pieces of curved glass bent at different angles were then used to form the sides of the fish tank, such that the size of the fish inside might be optically shrunk, allowing onlookers to move their eyes less when admiring his beloved fish.\nIt's just that such large pieces of glass are of fairly limited strength. Therefore, it would be unwise to tamper with the irritable kinds inside the fish tank, such as Betta, or else you will probably have to spend the whole day rescuing the dying fish, picking up glass shards, and cleaning up the floor.",

Only within a few years, she defeated all her competitors utterly and made a huge fortune out of this, all while making glazed pottery much more available to ordinary households. The whole affair went on so quietly that even to this day, the merchants who used to sell glazed pottery as luxury items cannot figure out where went wrong. From their points of view, the potters all \"suddenly received guidance from an expert and disrupted the pottery market once and for all.\"\nYet, as impressive as these machinations sound, the traveling merchant herself seems to almost forget about this.

Hence, they spent a fortune purchasing the technical know-how behind Liyue-style porcelain, which later took Sumeru pottery into a brand new era. Of course, the pottery pieces made with such techniques were branded as imported luxury items by these merchants.

It is said that this particular design was inspired by similar products in Liyue that were then adapted by researchers to Sumeru's local conditions, arts, and materials.

Fortunately, a sellsword with long black and gold hair was also at the scene. Seeing through the trap, she kicked down the long table and used it as protection. The Treasure Hoarders had spent all their arrows, but they failed to penetrate the table, and the Eremite member was barely scratched. In the end, the Treasure Hoarders all retreated in surprise. Since then, people have been more confident that the long table can withstand arrows.",

    "Description": "A heavy round shield, which looks like a regular round shield but in fact conceals a hidden secret.\nAthel Wood of moderate age and sturdy quality is selected and cut into planks of precise size and thickness. Smoking, waxing, and other processes will increase the planks' hardness to their greatest extent, before mortise and tenon structures are used to join them together. They are then affixed on three relatively light and soft backplanes to form a double-layer composite structure, which tries to wear down incoming blades and arrows to the greatest extent possible, weakening their power and absorbing their impact. At the same time, the frame is covered with a rigid iron structure, while reinforcing structures are placed at the vertex of the shield arc to resist the impact of blunt objects and opposing shields — and with that, the shield is complete.\nSuch shields are said to be able to fend off any attack from anyone without a Vision. Their price is also equivalent to dozens of ordinary weapons, which limits their users to small numbers of Eremite or Corps of Thirty elite troops.\nTreasure Hoarders, who prioritize the lightness of their equipment, can't comprehend why a sellsword would invest so much in a shield like this. Only a select few frontline mercenaries and the designer of this shield type understand the importance of such equipment. As a reckless youth, the shield designer once led an incursion into Aaru Village in search of his colleagues' nemesis, only to be defeated by a young guard. With a shield in her left hand and a spear in her right, the guard with heterochromatic eyes was a human avalanche, shattering the intruders' weapons and defensive equipment alike in a single charge, knocking them out with just the right amount of force, before handing them over to the aged guards, admonishing them, and releasing them. The shield's designer, though now reformed and no longer a criminal, still remembers the young guard with her differently-colored eyes, regarding her as the strongest warrior he has ever met. She was the reference point from which the principle of \"the greatest offense is the greatest defense\" was used to transform this venerable shield design into this style of round shield.\nAnd who knows? Perhaps it may yet withstand one of her blows should they ever meet again...",

As such, Cyno often takes advantage of this notion by going out empty-handed and acting like he's not working, which can catch his targets off guard, or by taking the briefcase to the tavern to sit at a table for a long game of Genius Invokation TCG until any onlookers tire of watching him.

This way, all that is needed will be to bring the Zaytun Peaches back to Aaru Village before leaving them be for a while until the light alcohol on the surface volatilizes, thus giving the fruits a texture almost identical to what they would have had if freshly-picked and ripe.

Putting a roof over workspaces is a formula for much decreased woes, even if many trivial things should happen during that time.",

It is said that such roofs were first built for the guards near the village entrance. One of the scholars temporarily dwelling in Aaru Village once suggested this: \"If we use vibrant colors for the guardhouse roof, people can quickly find them and thus locate those who can help them easily.\" Yellow objects are, in theory, quite striking, but in a place such as the desert, it is doomed to simply melt into the sandy backdrop...\nFortunately, the guards do not simply stand guard in one place, and these huts would later be repurposed, never again to become a thorn in the side of those seeking help.",

Some matra did try the instructions out for themselves, eventually concluding that \"these plants aren't half bad as cushions\" — save for the one person who tried stepping on this cushion 20,003 times, the final time upon which it exploded, sending that person flying into the air.\nOne day, one young subordinate, unable to contain their curiosity, brought a heavily-annotated manual to the General Mahamatra with the following two questions: \"which botanist did you ask to help with the manual?\" and \"what is the deeper meaning behind some of these seemingly simple and relaxed descriptions?\"\nAt this time, the General Mahamatra was in Gandharva Ville talking to a certain Forest Watcher with long upright ears. Hearing those questions, he finished his meal before telling two jokes that were no different from his usual fare with a completely straight face, leaving his young subordinate stunned for quite a while. Seeing their confusion, the General Mahamatra seemed ready to give a yet more detailed explanation, only for the Forest Watcher to quickly speak up, saying that \"You see, he just needs to write a few things to adjust the mood a bit. If you didn't understand what was being said, then it wasn't that important. And if you didn't find those descriptions funny, then there's no need to remember them!\"\nEnding the conversation hastily, this young subordinate would keep the Forest Watcher's words firmly in mind, and even shared them with their colleagues. Unfortunately, it seems that even today, these poor matra still have not yet fully understood the meaning of those words.",

Just one bite will do!'\"\n\"We had to explain to Paimon that it was meant as a standard template, upon which she reluctantly swallowed and promised not to try to eat it.\"\n\"The customers also understood our reasoning, and indeed started to look to the other items on sale in the shop, leading to a great number of meat items being sold!\"",

A variety of colorful balloons will be left to float across shallow waters, each containing a small reward within. Whoever can use the thin paper nets in the water to collect the balloon can claim the prizes they bear.\nIt takes a special kind of skill to draw in heavier objects without causing the paper netting to tear, so while those possessing the needed dexterous mastery might get rewards, newcomers will often find themselves empty-handed. Of course, no one should be overly disappointed about this, for this is just a small leisurely game before the grandness of the festival. Should you fail this time, you can always come again.

All cargo ships entering Port Ormos are unloaded using this crane.\nIn the last hundred years or so, Kshahrewar researchers have been attempting to popularize the use of construction machinery, and this crane was one result of their project. While increasing its lifting efficiency, the crane also takes up very little space and shares many foundational components with other structures in the area. Therefore, it doesn't require a specialized technician to repair, which greatly lowers its construction and maintenance costs. Moreover, these cranes allow Port Ormos to accommodate a higher volume of cargo influx through an increased deployment rate while keeping the budget unchanged.",

Only when there is little going on within the Serenitea Pot does she venture out at times to chat and have tea with old friends. As such... one might say that Tubby will likely not use this device.",

    "Description": "A large round table that is mounted within The Cat's Tail. It is made of lightly-scented Cuihua Wood and has a rather ingenious design that takes both its main uses — a site for Genius Invokation TCG matches and a tavern table — into account. Although the main support structure of this round table is in the middle, it will never have trouble remaining stable no matter how worn it is. This is thanks to Margaret, the owner of the tavern, having stressed the various use cases of such tables while speaking to the craftspeople. For example, it has to be able to withstand a heavy fall by someone defeated in a TCG match, or the slam of hands on the table by drunk customers tickled pink by a friend's humor... And most importantly of all, it has to be able to hold the bulk of The Cat's Tail's collection of rather sturdy feline specimens as they leap from table to floor to table, and survive any incidental impacts that might occur as they play. As for the high costs that came with the reinforcement of the tables' central structures... Well, so long as the cats are happy, there's no price too high!",

Moreover, every time she naps on this sofa, the duel cats would come over and snuggle up to her, leaving her coated with hard-to-clean cat hairs.

However, as she is also making a great many other fascinating mechanisms, combined with the complexity of the Puffy Tubby, the redesign could only be completed recently.

The exterior wall is made of beautiful and economic light yellow bricks that are produced from processed Tearstone. The main frame of the building is made from Cypress Wood supplemented with slag cement, a new material developed by the Fontaine Research Institute before the incident, giving it a very long lifespan.\nThe Fontaine Research Institute was researching a unique method of construction — using a metal frame and cement to create a new wood-free building. These buildings would remain standing even if the Emperor of Fire and Iron caused a ruckus on the roof. However, Fontaine lacks the resources to produce the requisite quantities of metal with high enough load-bearing strength. For this reason, mass production of things such as clockwork meka was given priority for Fontaine's metallurgic resources. In light of this, construction with a metal frame and slag cement has not gained widespread popularity.",

It is said that even a berserk clockwork meka going all out would have a hard time tearing it down.\nAccording to a certain tabloid, when the Adventurers' Guild built its Fontaine branch, they took the possibility of repeated inspections by the Maison Gardiennage and the huge pressure the heavy clockwork meka would exert on the flooring into consideration. Furthermore, if conflict were to rise with the Maison Gardiennage or if a clockwork meka were to go out of control, half the building could easily be destroyed. Thus, the Adventurers' Guild was willing to invest a huge sum in a strong structure utilizing a metal frame.\nWhen asked about it, the members of the Adventurers' Guild refused to comment on this or just responded with blank expressions. However, the local residents could clearly tell the relationship between the Adventurers' Guild and Maison Gardiennage was quite harmonious, nor was the building designed especially for the Adventurers' Guild. The article was seen as fabricating and spreading rumors. As a result, the author of the article soon became a pariah in Fontaine media industry.",

It is said that this building was designed with sufficient space for the installation of automation equipment, with various connections and pipeline channels reserved to make future upgrades to the production equipment much easier, resulting in the entire structure being modular to some degree.\nAdditionally, the Court of Fontaine has adopted strict standards on waste emissions, so the chimney-like structures above workshops are actually equipment that filters and pressurizes waste emissions, and stores them in liquid form. The residue and gas emission from smelting is processed multiple times to remove all harmful substances for reuse in the production of slag cement — a common construction material in Fontaine. Material produced in this manner only requires a rest period and a suitable coat of paint to make them completely harmless to the human body. It's a perfect example of proper resource recycling.",

While it may go unnoticed by the ordinary person, for those in the catering industry, it is highly detrimental to the long-term storage of goods. Thanks to the strict aromatic standards of a previous owner of Café Lutece, and with the help of The Steambird and protests from many others in the industry throughout the city, researchers dared not ignore the issue and began researching an improved formula that removed the lingering odor.

It is a product of early forays into modular architecture, and an example given in the Court of Fontaine Standards for Exterior Wall Decorations. Once construction using slag cement matured, architects believed rapid assembly of houses on a large scale was possible by making all the load-bearing walls in advance and using large clockwork meka to assist in construction.\nHowever, despite many attempts to adjust the coloration, an icy cold and gloomy gray were the only possible outcomes for slag cement. Housing and indoor architecture would be far too plain if built like that, and so light yellow bricks are still necessary for the exterior wall panels while tiles or wood flooring are required indoors. Thus, concerns about aesthetics and livability won out over the time savings promised by modular construction. Thus, the architects turned to another form of modular construction design that focused on structure and reserving space for internal piping.\nOf course, even if the architects succeed, there may not be much demand in Fontaine unless the Fontaine Research Institute is rebuilt — which is another complicated issue in itself...",

Unfortunately, the extremely high costs that came with Tearstone were beyond the means of most Fontainians.\nSo, they found a project team at the Fontaine Research Institute and requested the development of a construction material with similar strength to Tearstone that would be affordable for the general public. The researchers traveled in search of inspiration and finally found it in the process of smelting. They set out to design a \"stone\" that solidifies from a liquid form, and after decades of trial and error, they finally invented a cheap and resource-efficient material — slag cement.",

But sometimes, unknown parties use or steal the provisions within, causing great losses.",

While they generally serve as water tanks now, such barrels were originally designed for the brewing and easy retrieval of large quantities of various liquors that required extended fermentation periods. With the rise in popularity of a new drink called Fonta in Fontaine, the sales of alcoholic beverages have declined, resulting in reduced demand for these casks from the distilleries. Consequently, the barrel manufacturers have had to sell them at a low price to people living in the wilderness who lacked access to the water supply system. This has made these casks one of the most recognizable landmarks in the countryside of Fontaine.",

They discovered a long time ago that applying wax to ship sails prevented staining and excessive water absorption during rainy weather.\nHowever, with the advent of new devices to power ships, fewer Poisson residents are familiar with this process, and fewer still are concerned with the history of a tablecloth's finishing technique.",

    "Description": "Commonly found in the wild in Fontaine, the Cerulean Gem is brilliantly colored. Contrary to its dazzling appearance, the flower has nearly no fragrance. It swiftly curls into a hardened, fruit-like structure once plucked.\nA certain Melusine deployed to the field had a fondness for the floweret and referred to it as \"Golden Gem Flower,\" but was corrected by her human colleague stating that it was \"cerulean.\" In reality, the vision of Melusines is very different from humans, while her colleague happened to be color-blind. The Cerulean Gem is actually close to pale violet red or rosy as defined by the Fontaine Research Institute. Nonetheless, the story of the Cerulean Gem has become an interesting anecdote, known from the Maison Gardiennage to all the streets and alleys of the Court of Fontaine.",

The debate caused delays in other projects, eventually resulting in a compromise in which the definition of colors within the blue spectrum were significantly broadened.

From another point of view, they are undoubtedly benefiting Fontaine's ecosystem greatly as underwater cleaners.\nLegend has it that when maintenance meks were initially deployed, researchers made various demos to prove the technology for organizations like the Fishing Association, providing demo types along with instruction manuals. This was to explain the origin and features of this fish-shaped meka to the people of Fontaine, ensuring people wouldn't be confused or harmed when seeing them. However, the aggressiveness of the meka was overestimated, and the skill of the anglers underrated. With the disbandment of the maintenance project team, these technical demo meka are but decorations, offering a glimpse into the intriguing technological development of Fontaine.",

    "Description": "These simple sheds can be found in Poisson. Constructed with ordinary Cypress Wood frames, their interior spaces are spacious and can accommodate numerous storage boxes and tools. Poisson's residents are largely engaged in water-related occupations such as fishing and salvaging. The nature of these jobs means that their workplaces are not entirely fixed and often require the setting up of temporary sheds in the wilderness. However, typical tent structures do not adequately meet their need to withstand unpredictable winds and waves. Thus, temporary sheds with metal construction have emerged. It's worth noting that these sheds often feature a fish-shaped metal sign, one that is not to be mocked anywhere out in the wilds of Fontaine.",

However, this proved ineffective, as most people on the streets were in a hurry and uneager to accept some mysterious piece of paper thrust upon them by a stranger, never mind read it carefully. But just as everyone was at a loss, some promoters noticed that pedestrians sitting on benches were more inclined to read newspapers voluntarily. Therefore, they proposed that newspapers should not be forcibly handed to busy passersby, but should be placed in fixed facilities for people to read at leisure. The book and newspaper racks now scattered throughout the streets and alleys of Fontaine are the concrete realization of that brainwave.",

When in use, the relevant goods could be placed directly under it to then be lifted.\nHowever, the load-bearing capacity of the door frame could not meet the lifting requirements, and its loading and unloading efficiency proved unsatisfactory. The rate at which the device rusted when exposed to moisture for prolonged periods also exceeded initial expectations, with the potential for additional maintenance costs to arise in the future...\nTaking these various factors into account, the residents of Poisson decided to ask the overly confident engineer to leave after settling the payment.\nThe manufactured prototypes were not directly discarded, however.

Perhaps it was the vibrant shade or its striking scent, but a local tabloid once confidently claimed that they contained a certain slow-acting poison. According to that tabloid, people who lingered near these flowers for too long might experience physical issues such as insomnia, irritability, and swollen and painful eyes. After some time, another obscure tabloid asserted that a famous opera singer regularly consumed flower tea made from these flowers, this being the secret to the star's lasting youth.\nFor a time, there was heated debate amongst some Fontainians about these flowers and the relevant departments of the Palais Mermonia responsible for the city's landscaping. Some actively avoided these flowers, while others secretly wanted to take some home to cultivate them...\nWith few other options, the Palais had to invite a specialist in botany to write a seven-day editorial series on The Steambird, clearing up all the falsehoods and emphasizing that this type of flower was just ornamental, and had no other deeper impact on residents' lives apart from the lifting of their spirits.\nNowadays, these purple flowers also adorn the area before the Opera Epiclese's gates, and the rocky period these flowers underwent has long passed, thanks to the efforts of various parties.\nHowever, some novelists drew great inspiration from this particular farce. These folk with their fine humor wrote a series of related short-form novels on the theme of \"perilous flowers,\" with a particularly popular one being \"Peaceful Day Nine,\" which featured poisonous flowers as a means of committing a devious crime, and mentioned that the original form of the dangerous plant was that very same controversial shrub from before.\nTo avoid causing the same trouble as before, the author emphasized the following at the start of said story:\n\"This is entirely a work of fiction!\"\n\"...Nonetheless, the author is not encouraging you or your family members to consume this flower.\"",

    "Description": "An ordinary chair made of Mallow Wood that can be commonly seen throughout Petrichor. The primary feature of this type of chair is its folding support. This design also allows the user to adjust the seat height within a given range or even store the entire rack to save space and make it more portable. It is said that since Petrichor is relatively remote, the demand for chairs is correspondingly low. However, outside guests must still be taken care of, so convenient seats that are easily foldable and storable, and may be taken out and adjusted when a customer comes were created to meet this need.",

However, it is said that the residents of Petrichor have found a way to extend their flowering season, meaning that \"happiness\" is something that can be achieved and held onto through hard work.",
