As an official member of the Knights of Favonius, her strength in combat cannot be underestimated.\nAs a hyperactive child, meanwhile, her destructive capabilities cannot be overstated.\nAfter all, while other Mondstadt children her age are still playing with regular toys, Klee's favorite toys are... live explosives."
