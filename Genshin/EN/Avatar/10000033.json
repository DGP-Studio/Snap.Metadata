DMG dealt in this way is considered Elemental Skill DMG, and can only occur once every 1.5s.\n\nAfter 30s, or when the ability is unleashed again, this skill will end.

The longer Tartaglia stays in his Melee Stance, the longer the CD.\nIf the return to a ranged stance occurs automatically after 30s, the CD is even longer.\n\n<i>He chose the bow as his weapon precisely to overcome his weakness with it.

Even if the promise he makes is absurd, he will never break it.\nBe it exterminating all the dragons inside their lairs, venturing into a domain of extreme danger, or single-handedly overthrowing the territory of a nobleman...\nHe not only keeps his promises, but does so with finesse and surgical precision.

He and his father would cut holes open upon frozen lakes before sitting beside them and tending to their fishing lines.\nThis was no easy task, and would sometimes take the entire morning.\nBut whether it was chiseling away at the thick ice or the long waits in between catches, he was always accompanied by his father's unending tales of adventure.\nThese were stories of his father's adventures from when he was young, and they became the future that Tartaglia secretly envisioned for himself.\nSo he would pay close attention, putting himself into the shoes of the protagonist of those tales, immersing himself fully in them even as they waited for a fish to bite.\nEven after leaving home, Ajax, later to be known as \"Childe\" Tartaglia, would keep up that hobby of his.\nNo longer accompanied by the stories of bygone days, fishing instead became an opportunity to train — to hone his endurance, and reflect on combat techniques.\nSuch long periods of meditation to refine his skills swiftly relegated the question of a successful catch to irrelevance."

There, he would meet a mysterious swordswoman...\nOr perhaps one should say that this dark realm had sensed the burning ambition in this boy's heart.\nThis darkness was something that the Harbinger Childe could never again delve into.\nIn those three months, the swordswoman taught Tartaglia how to pass through the Abyss unhindered, and more importantly, nurtured the ability to stir up endless havoc from within Ajax's trouble-mongering nature.\nNo one knew what happened within that darkness during those three months, nor would Ajax ever speak of this to anyone.\nWhen his worried mother and sisters finally found him in that forest, only 3 days had passed in this world.\nThus did Ajax's first adventure end, with his now-rusty shortsword in hand.\nThis would mark the end of his youth and the beginning of his days as a warrior."

He acted as if this world revolved around him, and as if battle existed for his sake.\nConflict often brings about change, and this capricious, incalculable change attracted Ajax like a revolving kaleidoscope.\nIn the eyes of his father, that third son that he had so worried about had changed for the worse, bringing much uncalled-for havoc to the seaside village of Morepesok.\nOr perhaps it would be more accurate to say that Ajax had become a nexus of strife, for no matter where he went, fights and squabbles would follow — and he reveled in it.\nUltimately, after a huge brawl was pacified with some difficulty and with some near-fatal misses, his father had no choice but to hand his beloved son over for conscription into the Fatui.\nHe hoped that the strict military training of the Fatui could hone his son's temper, but wound up watching fully-armed troops getting the stuffing beaten out of them by a mere child.\nThis was a great disappointment to his father, but it also caught the attention of Pulcinella, the 5th Harbinger.\nShocked by Ajax's great strength and curious about how he invariably became the eye of a vortex of discord, Pulcinella inducted Ajax into the Fatui under the pretext of meting out punishment, ordering him to start from the bottom and take up the duty of serving the Tsaritsa.\nHis insatiable desire for conquest would thus be constantly satiated in fighting for the Fatui, and his ever-burgeoning ego would gorge upon the elation of vanquishing mighty foes...\nUntil at last, Ajax was chosen to be one of the Fatui Harbingers, donning the mantle of \"Childe\" Tartaglia and becoming one of the most powerful people in Snezhnaya.\nBut becoming Tartaglia was far from his end goal. To someone who sought to conquer the world, this was but a tiny step in his journey."

I will be home soon.
