He is also more than capable of participating in discussions on commerce, politics, and international relations.\nBut on a typical day, all you will glean from him is a few pieces of useless trivia, because he particularly enjoys sharing these fun tidbits with you."

As long as it catches his eye, Zhongli will pay as much as the owner asks. Indeed, he will even buy it at a premium sometimes.\nBut for some reason, Zhongli always forgets to bring money.\nFor small purchases, he has friends to help him out, and large bills he somehow finds ways to have written off.\nTo those merchants who secretly pride themselves on their powers of flattery, Zhongli is a man of strange proclivities: in truth, he knows a great deal about the value of money and finance, and he also understands the suffering of the people. However, he seems to not understand that poverty is part of the human condition.\nOr perhaps it might be said that he cannot imagine himself being poor.\nHow has such a person not died of hunger yet?"

The very money that circulates throughout Teyvat, Mora, is named after him.\nWhen night falls and bustling Liyue begins to slumber, he will sometimes stand atop the towering mountains and gaze upon this city, which he made with his own hands.\nTo the people of Liyue, Rex Lapis has many divine titles.\nWhen he laid down Liyue's laws by his divine might, he was the God of Contracts. When he minted the first Mora and made Liyue strong by dint of commerce, the merchants revered him as the God of Commerce.\nHe has lived through countless years and is the eldest of the Seven, and so historians call him the God of History.\nThousands of years ago, the forebears of the citizens of Liyue Harbor struck stones together to start fires and used piled stones to create stoves. These blessings derived from the Geo element led the Geo Archon to gain the title of God of the Stove.\nPeople from other lands tend to call him Morax, though the people of Liyue prefer to use the term Rex Lapis.\nBut in the hearts of lovers of opera and children, Morax's on-stage aspect, the all-conquering defender of Liyue — the Warrior God — is the most fascinating.\nThe delicacies that Rex Lapis discovered while lost in the streets, the plaques inscribed with his handwriting, a famous opera that he once starred in, playing the part of a warrior... Many stories and tales of Liyue are, when studied closely, stories of people visited by their deity at some point — and the citizens of Liyue are most proud indeed of that history."

Only a refined and strict order can sustain vibrant commerce, which is itself the lifeblood of Liyue Harbor.\nThus the Qixing punish violators of such laws unceasingly, not only to uphold the divine rulings of Morax but also to allow Liyue to maintain its vitality.\nThrough the millennia, every generation of the Liyue Qixing commits to interpreting the law, including subtle amendments to plug loopholes found in the law. Any loopholes that remain undiscovered are seen by the merchants as \"permissible if unaddressed,\" and they make killings off such holes until they are discovered and patched up by the Liyue Qixing.\nAmid this game of cat-and-mouse, the book that collates such amendments has reached a whopping 279 pages thick.\nThe person currently responsible for maintaining this book, the Tianquan Ningguang, is secretly (and humorously) referred to as the \"Tailor of Liyue,\" in honor of her speed in patching these laws up, and for her sharpness of eye.\nBut no matter how complicated or tangled mortal laws become, one of these stands above all others in the eyes of Rex Lapis.\n\"The one who reneges on their words shall suffer the Wrath of the Rock.\""

The Seven were a diverse lot and dispersed far and wide, but they all shouldered the burden of guiding humanity.\nAs time passed, many of The Seven's titles changed hands, and only two remain of the first Seven: Rex Lapis and the Anemo Archon.\nThe carefree Barbatos, the Anemo Archon, is the second eldest of The Seven.\nWhen Barbatos first came to Liyue, Rex Lapis believed his fellow archon to have encountered some terrible crisis in pursuit of their duties, thus requiring his aid.\nSo when Barbatos descended in a gust of wind, the Geo Archon had already prepared himself to receive this neighboring deity and lend what help he may.\nBut as he looked, the Anemo Archon tossed a wine bottle at him.\n\"Here's some wine from Mondstadt. Care for a taste?\"\nTo forsake one's duty to deliver a single bottle of wine — what a preposterous notion!\nYet the Anemo Archon kept coming to visit, to explore Liyue Harbor, all sorts of strange questions on his lips. The Anemo Archon's questions knew as little limits as the wine in his hands.\nFrom then on, the first Seven would often gather in Liyue.\nRex Lapis still remembers how those wines tasted.\nThe world has changed much since then, and all that was once familiar has faded into memory.\nThe seven seats changed and again were changed, till five of the seven at the table were all departed.\nNor would the duty of guiding humanity be honored by the new archons.\nEven the hardest rocks may be worn down after three thousand years.\nNor would the wind ever return again.\nOne drizzly day, the ancient ruler was strolling about Liyue Harbor, and overheard a merchant telling one of his workers,\n\"You've finished your duties, go ahead and call it a day.\"\nLong did he stand amidst the milling crowd.\n\"Have I... already finished my duties?\""

        "Context": "During the Archon Wars, every corner of Teyvat was consumed in the fires of conflict. Not only did gods fight amongst themselves, but countless wicked things also sought to expand their domains.\nOne such type of creature caused no end of woe for the Geo Archon, long before he took that title along with his place among The Seven.\nThese foul creatures, straight from the murky depths of the ocean abyss, had a squishy exterior, and possessed agile tentacles that would live on even after being cut off, even secreting some thick and revolting fluid in the process.\nThis alone would have been enough to make them the most monstrous of all creatures, and still it was not the pinnacle of their monstrosity.\nWhat made them so truly terrible was their small size, which gave them the ability to duck into unimaginably small nooks and crannies.\nNo space was too narrow for them, neither the wooden boards of tables and chairs, nor the seams of windows and doors and curtain folds, nor even books and brushes.\nMany a poor soul had, on at least one occasion, unwittingly outstretched their hand, only to quickly retract it in horror with a blood-curdling scream at the sensation of something cold, clammy and damp, while one or more of these despicable creatures came crawling up their arm, leaving a shiny trail behind them...\nAt the behest of the people of Liyue, Morax agreed to wipe these creatures out. But these parasites upon civilization could not be destroyed like enemies on a battlefield, by simply summoning a storm of stone spears that would shatter the earth and churn the soil...\nStill, he was the God of Contracts. His word had to be his bond.\nSo, he went through the town from house to house with prisons of stone, seizing these creatures one by one and locking them away for good...\nThis long campaign of pest extermination taught Morax the true meaning of \"a burden lifted.\"\nThe grueling campaign itself, and the terrible smell of those ocean creatures' secretions, left a lasting impression on the deity.\nToday, even when he goes out incognito as the mortal man, Zhongli, Morax gives those living, squirming seafood products a wide berth.\n...Well, except for dishes where said seafood products have been sliced and diced into oblivion, such as seafood tofu. He'll quite happily eat those."
