And regardless of the truth of such rumors, someone has to do something about them.\nChongyun was born into a renowned family of exorcists, and has possessed a natural ability to drive away evil spirits from a young age due to his pure-yang spirit. His powers of exorcism are far beyond the norm: his mere presence is sufficient to scatter evil spirits. \nHowever, this has proven to be an inconvenience for Chongyun himself, for though he has undertaken hundreds of successful exorcisms, he has never come face-to-face with a single ghost or demon.\nChongyun believes in his heart that a true exorcist should exorcize evil with charms and swordsmanship. This natural ability that he has... is just not orthodox.\nTherefore, he has dedicated himself to the study of exorcism techniques and martial arts, as well as seeking the haunts of evil spirits to prove himself an able and professional exorcist even without his unique physical condition.\nYet, when will that condition stop being a stumbling block on his path to self-realization?"

And not only did the noises persist, they even grew in boldness.\nIt was then, just when she had given up all hope, that Chongyun walked through her door.\n\"I apologize for coming just now, it has been far too sunny lately... I heard that this place houses a very stubborn ghost. Please, leave it to me.\"\nThen Chongyun brought a chair over, and sat upon it in the middle of the house for a time.\nThat night, the strange sounds were no more.\nThe wealthy woman finally had a good night's sleep, and she came running to Chongyun the next morning with an overabundance of gold and jewelry as a reward.\nBut Chongyun, as was his wont, only accepted his usual fee of a few hundred Mora without an ounce of emotion on his face.\nEver since that incident, Chongyun has found that his reputation precedes him for miles around. He has become beloved in Liyue for his \"style and character,\" and indeed scholars have given him this appellation: \"a heart of clear water, and a face of ice.\""

When he heard about an evil spirit in Dragonspine, he made for the peak wearing only a shirt.\nThough it was hard enough to keep himself warm, he still felt this insufficient. Digging a hole in a frozen lake, he jumped in and soaked in the icy water while waiting for the evil spirit to show itself.\nAfter staying in the lake for half a day, he finally caught a glimpse of his target.\nHowever, after pursuing it down to the mountainside, he discovered it was only a snow rabbit that had been frightened off by his flying swords and floating charms.\nThe fever that he ran afterward lasted far longer than it would in a normal person."

And though he waited until all the dishes had gone cold, he did not expect the tender rice balls to be stuffed with Jueyun Chili.\nAfter but a single bite... Chongyun had no recollection of what happened next.\nHowever, according to the victim, chef Xiangling of Wanmin Restaurant, many unforgettable things happened.\nChongyun first jumped onto the reception desk and shouted, \"Everything's on me tonight!\" — never mind that he did not actually have any money on him.\nHe then began to chat with customers at other tables as if they were old pals, bragging to them of how incredible his clan's exorcist arts were, never forgetting to taste other people's dishes on the tables before he left.\nLastly, he claimed to have sensed an evil spirit in Wanmin Restaurant. This he did not find, but he did slap a charm on Xiangling's forehead and chase her around with his sword.\nAfterwards, Chongyun scrimped and saved for an entire month to pay Wanmin Restaurant back for the mess and any damages he might have caused; he also gave Xiangling an evil-warding talisman that he carved by hand.\nBut Xiangling, for her part, didn't mind Chongyun's \"transgressions\" at all.

Since then, Chongyun has no longer sought to alleviate his condition. Instead, he now tries to get Xingqiu to come with him to find such a spirit.\n\"What? Sightings of the legendary Aoyin near the Sea of Clouds? Leave it to me!\"\n\"The old house at Feiyun Slope has been taken over by an evil spirit? My bad. I'll attend to it right away.\"\n\"A master exorcist is staying over at Wangshu Inn? I could learn a lot from him... Hmm, better go with a gift.\"\nXingqiu usually just makes these \"leads\" up as he goes, and thanks to his \"advice,\" Chongyun often comes back empty-handed, blaming his bad luck.\n\"I tried my best to look for it, and even spent quite a sum purchasing more intelligence on that evil spirit — but I wound up missing it by a hair anyway,\" Chongyun says, abashed.\nIf Xingqiu has time to spare when such an occasion arises, he will encourage Chongyun, treat him to some new cold dishes he has found and then set off to get Chongyun's swindled money back.\nA warm and reliable companion, indeed! — So Chongyun thinks at such moments.

Even the sound of that scares him a hundred times more than freezing in a lake on Dragonspine.\nHowever, he has also heard everyone sing yearning praises of these hot springs, praising their comfort, and asserting that they become more so the hotter they are, and that one is filled with energy for a whole week afterward.\nChongyun still doesn't know if this is true or if people are just teasing him.\nAnd he would have dared to try it out, if not for the ever-present problem of his pure-yang spirit.\nXingqiu once asked him this:\n\"If you were able to master your yang energy and rid the world of all evil spirits someday...what would you do after that?\"\nThis seemingly off-the-cuff remark troubled Chongyun deeply.\nPerhaps he had indeed missed out on a lot in life on account of his condition.\nBut he doesn't regret spending time. If one way of living doesn't work, he just needs to find himself another — and in any case, he already has his answer.\nIf that day comes, well, he'll go to the hot springs then."

Unwilling to break with this artistic tradition, he was at a loss.\nUltimately, he would attempt to use his imagination to draw some suitably strange images.\n—Thus did the Field Guide to Demons and Beasts grow ever more exotic.
