At present, Lisa's job is to oversee the book collection in the library owned by the Knights."

I suppose I shall need a Vision, then.\"\nAnd just like that, as that thought popped into her mind, her Vision popped into her hand.\nWith the aid of her Vision, Lisa acquired the knowledge that she sought. But she also sensed the deep secret hidden in the shadows of that knowledge.\nFor whatever reason, the gods gave humans the key to changing everything, but they did not explain the cost involved. Lisa grew fearful of the truth.\nThe Vision that hung from her neck became to her a bottomless pit filled with sweet delights, lingering at the back of her mind.\nSo, from time to time, when somebody whom she finds interesting comes along, Lisa will pass onto them her understanding on all kinds of matters.\nPerhaps she is secretly hoping that by doing so, one day someone will come along who has the ability to understand the ultimate truth behind Visions."
