His wonderful ingenuity always makes people want to buy his merchandise.\nMr. Hushang, who sells toys, has very dexterous hands. With them, he fashions the most fascinating little toys, and they are very popular amongst children.\nAnd, of course, everyone has long regarded this smart red-haired girl as a family member too.\nEvery time Nilou goes grocery shopping, she always ends up carrying more items than on her purchase list just by making a single trip through the streets, and the weight of the groceries shows exactly how much people like and take care of Nilou.\nOf course, Nilou also takes care of them in return.\nHushang and Farhad may have a quarrel over a bet, about as long as Nilou shows up, the two will surely be reconciled.\nIf Afshin's Sumpter Beasts have stolen someone else's food, Nilou will come forward and help make amends.\nIf you ask Nilou why she is so enthusiastic, she will answer with a smile:\n\"Because family is supposed to help each other, hehe.\"\nFor Nilou, her mom and dad are her small family, while everyone in the Grand Bazaar is her big family."

I can assure you that they are safe.\"\n...Nilou would dismiss her hesitation in an instant and raise her arms in a dance-like graceful gesture of thanks, before indulging in the joy of having solved a great problem for a long time indeed."

        "Context": "Refusing to accept gifts on stage has been a long-standing rule in the Zubayr Theater.\nSometimes, the audiences do still get too excited and may insist on giving various kinds of gifts to Nilou. That said, such givers will definitely receive a gift in return the very next day, along with a note that has been left at their doors...\n\"Thank you for your kindness. If you would like to express your love for Nilou's dance, you may write a letter to the Zubayr Theater instead of sending gifts.\"\nAnd so it came to pass that like snow flakes dancing and falling in the air, letters filled with the audience members' passionate praise have been sent in batches and droves by the Dusk Birds to the theater's mailbox.\nDuring her free time when there are no shows or rehearsals, Nilou will read every letter carefully, share this joy with the other members of the Zubayr Theater, and then carefully preserve these letters.\nEvery word and every expression of recognition and fondness in the letters is worth remembering and appreciating.\nAs Nilou bettered her dancing skills, more and more people came to watch her dance, and in time, the letters have added up to quite the stack indeed.\nBut if someone cracks a joke, saying that Nilou is the most valuable treasure in the Zubayr Theater, she will definitely shake her head with a sweet smile.\n\"Our most valuable treasure is our audience's love, and it is all carefully stored in one mysterious box.\""

        "Context": "Nilou has heard her teacher talk about the meaning of dance more than once. From her teacher's perspective, dance is born from human life and has belonged to everyone from the very beginning.\n\"As a dancer, you should convey emotions on stage, and your audience's smiles are their response to the emotions conveyed in your dance.\"\nNilou was well aware that she was nowhere near as good at thinking about the \"meaning\" behind things as Akademiya researchers. But still, she practiced diligently each day under the direction of her teacher and planned to continue following in her footsteps.\nWhen she finally first took the stage, she quickly became completely immersed in the performance, holding nothing back.\nShe thought of the wind, the moon, the gentle sound of the rose blooming, the feeling of stroking the tail feathers of Dusk Birds, and a myriad of beautiful things that existed in this world.\nShe wanted to display the beauty she perceived in her heart to the entire audience through her dance.\nSlowly, splashes of water ran together, converging into a lake on the stage. Like a Crystalfly dancing on a lake's surface, Nilou gently fluttered back and forth, and the lake-mirror rippled slightly in time to her steps.\nLike a water lily, her body swirled in the middle of that lake. Amazed at such pure and flawless beauty, the audience almost forgot to breathe.\nAfter the curtain fell, Nilou flopped down on the backstage chair and took deep breaths.\nLike dewdrops on a lotus leaf, a Hydro Vision had appeared at her waist.\nNilou thought then that she had perhaps found the purpose of dance at last — \n\"To become beauty, and then to convey the beauty and value of art.\""
