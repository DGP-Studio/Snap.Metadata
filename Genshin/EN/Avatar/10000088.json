During this effect's duration, it will deal <color=#99FFFFFF>Cryo DMG</color> to affected opponents at intervals.\n\n<color=#FFD780FF>Hold</color>\nPopping Monsieur Verite's viewfinder open, Charlotte enters Composition Mode, and during this time, the viewfinder will expand as you hold until you reach a Finisher Frame state. In this state, Charlotte can move and change direction freely.\nWhen the hold state ends, Monsieur Verite will deal <color=#99FFFFFF>Cryo DMG</color> to all opponents locked on within the viewfinder, and apply the same Snappy Silhouette as Tap Mode does to them. If you unleash this ability only after reaching Finisher Frame, you will instead apply Focused Impression, which lasts longer and deals more DMG, although the Skill CD will be longer.\nComposition Mode lasts a maximum of 15s and allows a maximum of 5 opponents to be selected.\n\n<i>\"Press photography requires simple shots with exceptional theming, but most of all, you need to have a knack for capturing the moment!\"</i>",

For example, there's \"The Observer\" for celebrity gossip, \"Leisure Weekly,\" which focuses on competitive sport and other entertainment news, \"Top Chef\" for those who like to read... all the food critiques in one place, and \"Bedazzled!\" which is just sort of a glorified rumor and speculation mill.

Then, I put it all in an article and had it published in the paper. The backlash was intense. They were punished for their crimes, sure, but that didn't stop them from launching a vicious campaign of vengeance against me almost immediately. I was coming home to threat letters sitting on my bedside table on a daily basis, and we'd also find mud slung on the front door to our office... The Steambird quickly filed a report to the Gardes, and I was sent to Mondstadt to report on Genius Invokation TCG. It took a while before I could safely return to Fontaine.

Some fishmonger in Poisson might suddenly buy three months' worth of fish in a single month, or countless flyers boasting of a certain place where especially delicious fish can be found might suddenly appear in the Court...\nIn the eyes of a mediocre reporter or ordinary city folk, these are \"independent\" tales, just like there will always be waves rippling across the sea's surface — such ordinary events are barely worth paying attention to at all.\nClumsier journalists might even chase these waves, and dispiritedly end up merely following the wave's patterns, constantly pumping out \"surface-level stories\" of little interest.\nBut in Charlotte's eyes, these waves are but the superficial representation of other forces. What is causing them to crest and break? That is the story she seeks.\nPerhaps it is the wild winds wailing over the surface, or perhaps they are due to the Thalatta Submarine Canyon's complex seabed topography. Of course, you can't rule out the possibility of tremors from the Elton Trench either...\nThese stories are the \"deep dives\" Charlotte desires.\nA reporter should be an agile \"seeker\" — not a mere gauche \"recorder.\"\nThis, then, is Charlotte's \"work doctrine.\"\nAs to how she avoids being swept up in her \"deep dives\"... well, that's up to Euphrasie and her fellow citizens!"

The children gladly padding about in puddles on the leaf-strewn streets after a storm and their hapless laughing families. The beauty of a solitary shell on the seashore, and the tiny crab surveying the world from underneath. The Blubber Profiterole she had with her family on her birthday, and the ever-so-slightly-too-deep color of the cream...\nTo most, a flower is a flower, a shell is a shell, and a Profiterole is still a Profiterole even if it is a bit too sweet — that's just how the world is.\nBut to Charlotte, these hidden \"details\" — only visible out of the corners of her eyes — are essential to understanding the world.\nCharlotte's father, a seasoned reporter and professional nature photographer, noticed his daughter's interest in and knack for \"observation.\" Thus, on her tenth birthday, he gave her a custom-made Kamera, its dimensions and the positions of its buttons built specially for her.\n\"Not all people are attentive enough to seek out and observe subtle differences, but this, Charlotte, is your unique talent.\"\nThose were the words of her father, the \"Reporter of the Idylls,\" Galanopoulo.\nFrom then on, there was a little junior reporter by the senior reporter's side. This father-daughter tag team could be found on streets wide and narrow, forests and rivers alike, raising two Kameras, one large and one small, taking countless still images of moving beauty.\nEven though their \"interviews\" always caused the gentle yet strict Mrs. Gagnepetit to nag them incessantly, Charlotte's laughter never failed to be the quickest way to make her mother stop. And as for her soiled clothes and dirtied hat, those were left to the ever-capable Mr. Galanopoulo.\nTo her, the whole world is a giant treasure trove.\nAnd those pictures, for their part, are her special treasure maps."

The editors were quickly taken with their photos — especially Charlotte's — and profusely praised Galanopoulo's ever-improving photography skills, reserving, just as before, prime placement for them in their publication.\nThose pictures caused quite a stir in the Fontainian photography space when they were published, with critics stumbling over each other to flatter them, and newspaper hobbyists fighting to get copies to make their clipping collections yet more colorful and vivid.\nBut when both critics or fellow journalists came calling and asked how Galanopoulo advanced his aesthetic sensibilities by leaps and bounds...\nThe veteran reporter lightly pushed Charlotte forward, saying calmly: \"Ah, such pictures are beyond me. It's all my daughter's handiwork!\"\nThe experienced, learned ladies and gentlemen who had come knocking could not but fall silent first, before expressing surprise, and then beginning to whisper amongst themselves and even venturing a few questions.\nCharlotte blinked. The bewildered adults before her seemed every bit like little insects searching for shelter in a storm, waving their antennae this way and that, crying \"Where are the leaves? Where are the leaves?\"\n\"Hey, everyone, look this way!\"\nThe young child's cry caused them to collectively leap out of their worn skins, and everyone turned to look, only to be greeted by a custom-made Kamera and the click of a shutter.\nIn that moment, all of it was captured on film — the furrowed brows, quirked lips, red faces, tangled hair, and waving arms, perfectly encapsulating those panicked bugs in the storm.\nThe little reporter patted her Kamera and smiled toothily.\n\"I'll call this one...

Even Euphrasie, the Editor-in-Chief of The Steambird, was amongst them.\nEuphrasie was straightforward about her intent. She hoped that Charlotte would agree to become a \"special correspondent\" — someone who would conduct interviews and write articles in addition to taking photographs.\n...However, her father, despite his usual mild temperament, was strongly against it. He did not wish for his daughter to associate with those kinds of people, either full of ulterior motives or hypocrites.\n\"Nature is fierce, but it is honest. Storms don't loose their fury without reason, nor do beasts bare their fangs without cause.\"\n\"But people lie — they always do. A Kamera can only capture their faces, but the lens cannot target their hearts.\"\nHe would respect Charlotte's decision, of course, but he preferred that Charlotte live a simpler, happier life, without sinking into the morass of humanity.\nTo Charlotte, this world was a treasure trove, and pictures her treasure maps.\nBut for the first time, she came to realize that this trove still harbored undiscovered \"truths.\"\nThese truths were not themselves treasures, but were more akin to a procession of dark memories. Intentionally hidden, discarded, disguised, and then abandoned, with those having done so wishing that they would never be discovered, and that all events connected to them would simply end right there.\nCharlotte knew that she could find them. She could dig up these truths, like digging tulip bulbs in a garden, like leading hermit crabs out of their shells, like finding pinecones hidden by squirrels.\n...But she also felt like a bird glimpsing an onrushing flash flood, a cave rat foreseeing an earthquake, or a fish sensing a coming tsunami.\nWith great ability comes great responsibility.\nOne with the talent for uncovering \"truth\" was also responsible for bringing the \"truth\" to light.\nThe only question was, did she have the courage to do so?\nHer parents responded with silence, for they knew that their daughter had already made her choice. Charlotte was old enough, and all birds are destined to spread their wings and leave the nest someday.\nThe next morning, Euphrasie went to work as usual, and there, waiting for her at the entrance to The Steambird, she saw Charlotte, ready with her Kamera and notepad.\n\"Welcome to The Steambird, Charlotte.\"\nEuphrasie extended a hand.\n\"I believe the next La Verite Prize is yours to win.\""

In fact, her reporting stands out so far above the rest that she has won the prize several times in a row.\nCritics have lavished her with praise, lauding her \"unequaled sense of composition,\" \"incomparably fresh angles,\" \"unquestionable impartiality,\" and \"unparalleled flair\"...\nDetractors, on the other hand, believe that her successive triumphs are the result of collusion between The Steambird and the prize selection committee. How could such a young and unorthodox reporter be showered with glory, if not so the newspaper employing her could also bask in that glow? And why else would she be so close to the committee members, anyway?\nEven so, her talents are beyond doubt. As another round of selection for the La Verite prize drew near, all her colleagues believed that she was guaranteed to emerge victorious once again.\nThey'd seen how she infiltrated the haunts of criminal rings alone and secretly visited illegal sweatshops... For report after report, Charlotte had braved unspeakable dangers and endured unimaginable hardships to bring the truth to readers... Whether it be in her professional dedication to the profession, her masterful manuscripts, or her attitude toward reporting, Charlotte was worthy of the committee's favor.\nThe question on everyone's minds, really — especially those of the sponsors — was \"Which one of her reports will she submit to the committee?\"\nIt would, after all, be her ticket to the La Verite Prize, and that would make it a collectors' item of... considerable value, surely.\nBut to everyone's astonishment, Charlotte unexpectedly declared that her submission would be a brand-new, never-before-published report, one that would reveal some heretofore unrivaled \"truth.\"\nDear readers, to find out, please subscribe to The Steambird and look out for tomorrow's headline!"

Red and shame-faced, the gentlemen flapped their clumsy lips as best they could, only to produce explications akin to porous cheese. In the end, they had to declare the questions out of order and in violation of normal procedure, before fleeing right before the gathered reporters' eyes.\nCharlotte's \"report\" had barely begun, though.\nShe continued publishing articles concerning the La Verite Award in The Steambird, even directing her pen against certain figures in the newspaper itself who had been connected to the La Verite selection committee, laying out the manner in which they had recommended reporters with whom they shared beneficial arrangements for awards, and how those reporters had returned the favors...\nCharlotte's articles swept through the Fontainian media world like a tidal wave, and in response to public outcry, the Maison Gardiennage declared an official inquiry into the Award, suspending its activities and investigating all suspicious awardees.\nCharlotte, for her part, temporarily lived inside The Steambird's offices, with all prospective visitors \"wanting a word with her\" being turned away by Euphrasie with extreme prejudice. It reached the point where the Maison Gardiennage even dispatched a guard detail to the newspaper's office entrance.\nWith her own hand Charlotte had lifted a huge stone that none had wanted to peek under, and the creepy crawlies that had lurked in its cracks and crevices now had to face the searing sunlight of the \"truth.\"\nThe Maison Gardiennage's investigation concluded three months later. Judges who had given unjust judgment, contestants who had contended to win glory undeserved, and editors who sought to edify themselves all received their just deserts.\nThe La Verite Award selection committee was also wholly reorganized, now under various forms of new oversight. Once this was complete, the first thing they did was to give Charlotte the now utterly discredited award.\nOf course, the trophy was but dead dross to her.\nThe real honor she had received was that the \"truth\" she had revealed in her report — and the ones that followed in its wake, of course — now shone in the sun."

Nevertheless, in the end they agreed to make the modifications, including a high-powered loudspeaker that, when activated, unleashed an ear-splitting alarm, as well as a hidden self-defense system on the Kamera's side that ejected a concealed knife outward at high speed when the right button was pressed...\nThey also included \"a shutter delay device,\" a \"lens self-coupling setup,\" and more...\nAll the concerns and worries of her father were installed into the device along with all manner of contraptions, transforming it into an ever-reliable, unequaled super Kamera that reflected its owner perfectly.\nAnd when the modifications were finished, Charlotte gave it a new name — \"Verite.\"\nMeaning, of course, \"truth.\""

The chubby-faced man did not seem keen on speaking the truth, and indeed was only interested in answering any questions insofar as he might redirect them. The divers he employed, too, proved quite tight-lipped.\nDespite the serious damage that had been done to their lungs and eardrums, the long work hours exhausting them utterly, the decrepit divesuits they used, and the inedible food, they held their silence in front of Dollander. Their smug boss smiled triumphantly at her lack of progress.\nBy the next day, Charlotte had procured a divesuit through personal connections and was ready to get close to the divers in secret as they worked, and use her Kamera to capture Dollander's ill-treatment of them firsthand. They were in a titanic undersea rift, a place where it was completely forbidden to work according to Fontainian diving regulations.\nAfter that, Charlotte did not appear at work for a good long while. All the other Steambird reporters saw was a stream of Maison Gardiennage officers coming in and out of the office, with Euphrasie uncharacteristically ruffled, working late into the night every day.\nSome reporters said that they saw someone dressed in outmoded clothes, drenched and shivering as they squatted at the office entrance.\nSome said that an undersea earthquake had occurred in the Thalatta Submarine Canyon, where divers employed by some fellow named Dollander had been working, and that they had avoided injury by the skin of their teeth.\nSome other reporters even said that this Dollander had secretly put out a bounty for a Kamera that was said to contain pictures important to him.\nStill, Charlotte did not emerge.\nBut reporters are most certainly not a passive lot. The Steambird's reporters began to act quietly and surreptitiously. Some utilized their personal connections to look into Dollander's business, while others followed the divers, and others still wrote pieces implicating Dollander...\nWith The Steambird working at full steam, it was fearsomely quick indeed, and before long an extensive report on Dollander's illicit employment practices was complete.\nHowever, without any photographic evidence to corroborate the article, the reporters felt it was...\nJust then, the doors to the main entrance were suddenly flung wide open, and in strode Charlotte, clad in rags and sans spectacles and shoes. Placing Monsieur Verite on the table, she grinned.\n\"I have the pictures right here!\"\nNo questions were asked about what she'd been through. Instead, all worked as one, focusing on slotting each image into the report.\nThe next day, The Steambird headline was this — \"Dollander: Undersea Scrooge,\" detailing his illegal employment practices, salary deductions, the harm done to the health of his employees, and other vile conduct. As for the article's author, it was listed as \"The Steambird Reporters.\"\nThe night before that edition was to be published, Charlotte was, as always, in the printing room doing some final proofreading work.\nWhen she finished reading the final word and put the manuscript down, she suddenly noticed that an icy-blue Vision had appeared beside her hand.\nScrutinizing it, all she could manage was to mumble a few words:\n\"I think we'll have to leave out this little detail...\""
