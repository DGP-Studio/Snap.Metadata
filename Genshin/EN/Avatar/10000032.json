Always walking the thin line between life and death, Bennett can't help but wonder.\nBennett knows that the old adventurer who saved him has left many praiseworthy stories and legends after his death.\nHe knows that adventurers will not have weeping at their funerals, only toasts made in their names by old comrades.\nHe knows, to the adventurers of Mondstadt, a \"good death\" comes at the end of a life given to the pursuit of treasure and the secrets of the world. Once over, their souls are brought back to their homeland by Barbatos.\nHe once feared death.\nHowever, after pondering on this matter some more, he now feels death may be something fortunate for an adventurer...\nNot that fortune has anything to do with him.\n\"Onto the next treasure!\" And with that, Bennett puts this thinking business behind him."

        "Context": "Whenever he suffers severe injuries such as fractures or excessive loss of blood, Bennett will go to the Cathedral to seek treatment from Deaconess Barbara.\n\"Sorry, it's me again...\" Bennett will say, scratching the back of his head.\nBarbara, however, will just shake her head, and with a \"let's deal with those scratches as well,\" she will toss him some adhesive bandages.\nSuch displays of concern may be inadvertent, but they have a special place in Bennett's heart. He sticks those bandages on his wounds with the care of one pinning a medal to their chest, before thanking her wholeheartedly.\nBennett keeps many such bandages in his utility pouch when he goes on adventures. Ones he gets from his dads, from Barbara, from Katheryne... and from adventurers he sometimes meets by chance after getting injured.\nThese tiny tokens of goodwill form a tangible collection of fair fortune unique to Bennett.\n\"Well, since everyone's by my side, I guess I'm not that unlucky after all.\""

        "Context": "Bennett's passion for adventure is unstoppable.\nHe wants to constantly explore, challenge, sweat it out, and eventually grow old on the adventurer's path.\nBut there was once when he met with a true crisis.\nJust as that old adventurer had so long ago, Bennett was in a predicament that would cause any other person to despair.\n\"Losing this much blood... Not good.\"\nBut Bennett did not stop. \"There's no reason to turn back,\" he thought.\nSomehow, he just knew that all the agonizing misfortune he had suffered up till this point was for the sake of overcoming this precarious position.\nBut at the end of his hellish journey, what he found at the end was — nothing at all.\n\"Ha, returning empty-handed is... part of an adventure. I... don't mind...\"\nAt last, his tightly-wound emotions came loose, allowing his many injuries to rob him of his consciousness, and he collapsed.\nWhen he reawakened, he found that his wounds had been cauterized by a mysterious flame, stopping both the bleeding and the pain.\nA jewel pulsed warmly in the palm of his hand, its rhythm in time with the heartbeat in his chest — the beating heart of an adventurer.\nThis was not the mercy of the world, or that fate took pity on him. Rather, this was his \"final reward,\" one befitting a person with Bennett's burning passion."
