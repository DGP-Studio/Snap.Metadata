The cost of raising the Sumpter Beasts was covered by the amusement park's revenue in no time.\nDori's love for Sumpter Beasts is genuine, and so is her intention to make Mora out of that love.\nPerhaps the Jinni in Dori's lamp knows this better than everyone else. The spirit was tricked into entering Dori's lamp, but it has never left since.\nDori will summon it into combat, but she will also grant its wishes afterwards.\nSometimes the Jinni even thinks that the fairy tale might actually have gotten things reversed —\nFor the one who dwells in the lamp is a powerful fighter, while the one holding the lamp is the one who grants wishes."

The various costs tend to amount to a fairly large expenditure, but Dori is never stingy in this regard. She even pays in advance.\n\"I, Dori, never default on payment.\"\n\"Also, Ms. Alice has expenses, too.

At this time, their home came to be ringed by a great many strange adults.\nThe strangers explained the elder sister's situation in serious tones and with unfathomable jargon before sighing at the dingy little room.\nThe younger sister had no idea what was happening, but she visited her sister every day, and her sister would always say this to her with a bright smile:\n\"It's alright. I just need some rest.\"\nSeeing that smile, the innocent younger sister's eyes filled with expectation. She even began looking forward to playing together like they used to.\nBut one day, she saw her sister gripping her chest while telling a story.\nThen, when her frail form collapsed onto the bed, the younger sister reached out to catch her, only to find that her body was so very light.\n...It was almost as if her sister were a feather, a feather that might drift away to some place far, far away.\nLater on, the younger sister found a crumpled note.\nIt was a doctor's prescription, with a list of herbs that were desperately scarce — the collectors who had such herbs were few and far between.\nTo purchase those herbs would cost more than tens of millions of Mora, an impossible price for a family that was already struggling to make the ends meet.\nThe elder sister always shook her head with a smile to dismiss her family's insistence on following the prescription. Perhaps she herself could only find the courage to glance at that note in the deep hours of the night — and dare to dream that she might \"live.\"\nUpon finding out about the note, the younger sister put it into her pocket silently and resolved to save her sister.\n\"I must make a lot of Mora.\"\n\"With enough Mora, my family will never have to smile at me while swallowing their pain, and I will never have to lose anything due to lacking Mora...\"\nPerhaps it was at that moment that the gods looked upon her with mercy.\nBut to an \"ambitious\" person like her, getting a Vision was just the start.\nIn the countless days and nights that have followed, she has constantly kept herself calm and clear-headed, telling herself:\n\"Conviction alone is not enough. I will work hard for what I desire until the end of my days.\"\n\"There's nothing that Lord Sangemah Bay cannot achieve.\""
