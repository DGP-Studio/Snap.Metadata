May your cup always run over with the sweet wine of celebration. May it always be refreshing as springs of ever-melting snow.\"\nFrom that day on, the spring fairy would never appear before Diona again, and she left those memories behind, consigning them to her childhood dreams.\nTill today, she has yet to realize that her troublesome constitution has anything at all to do with that dream."

        "Context": "Diona's father Draff is also interested in mixing the occasional drink.\nDiona's tail would wag from side to side of its own accord as she watched her father rocking the shaker back at forth at night.\nBut young Diona also found that her father would wind up particularly drunk on such nights, becoming dead to the world before he could even finish her bed-time story.\nThus, when Draff went out to hunt one day, she hid the shaker, squirreling it away in the deepest place under her bed.\nUnexpectedly, her father didn't bother looking for the lost shaker at all. He simply brought a new one back the very next day.\nWhen Diona went to Cat's Tail to try out for the role of bartender, Margaret noticed how the cocktail shaker Diona had with her looked wholly unsuited for her style.\nEver skilled with handicraft, Margaret would give Diona a cocktail shaker equipped with a lovely cat's tail as an induction gift.\n\"Now, this suits you far better,\" Margaret said with a satisfied nod."

        "Context": "Diona's antipathy towards alcohol is not \"hate\" per se. Instead, it can be considered a form of \"avarice.\"\nShe wishes for her father to always be the man that she admires, and she treasures every moment that she spends with her family, unwilling to \"share\" her happiness with the wine.\nThere was once a storm that lasted for three days, and for those three days, her father, who had been out hunting, did not return.\nThe awful weather prevented the search parties sent by the Knights of Favonius from making much headway, and soon the dread of \"loss\" began to hang over Diona like a shroud.\nIf she could not even stand to \"share,\" how could she bear having something utterly \"stolen\" from her?\nShe burst out the door and into the tempest, and the waters that stood in her path were frozen by some power she did not recognize.\nUsing her superlative tracking skills, she found her father under a broken gorge.\nWith the help of the other hunters, she returned home with her father, and only once she realized that he would be fine did she finally smile again.\n\"Do you... want me to mix you a drink? It'll numb the pain a little...\"\nThat was probably the first time she ever mixed a drink in a normal fashion.\n\"Ooh, it's so refreshing. It's wonderful! HahahaâOuch...\"\nGetting to drink a cocktail that his daughter had made was probably a better anesthetic by far than the alcohol itself.\nStill, Diona gaining power over Cryo did not help reconcile her to wine at all."
