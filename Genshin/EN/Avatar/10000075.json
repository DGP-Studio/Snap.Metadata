Holding sprint will cause persistent Kuugoryoku Point consumption to maintain speed. This effect will replace his default sprint.\n·Jumping expends extra Kuugoryoku Points to increase hovering height.

Today, many of these past affairs have been forgotten.\nThe puppet, the eccentric Kabukimono, the 6th seat of the Fatui Harbingers, The Balladeer...\nEach of these was a thread of fate tying the puppet's joints down.\nAny recollection must begin several hundred years ago, when the puppet that shed tears upon being born would not be given a name, but was instead only given a small golden feather as proof of his personage.\nHe would be laid to rest within the Shakkei Pavilion, staring blankly at the beauteous scenery within. The flaming maple leaves, the exquisite window lattices... Within that lovely prison, he lost all perception.\nIt was by accident that a kind-hearted samurai named Katsuragi would enter the pavilion and rescue him. It was Katsuragi who brought him to live in Tatarasuna and meet the people who lived there.\nThen, the puppet was as naive as a newborn, filled with goodwill and gratitude towards humans. Katsuragi, upon seeing the golden pinion on his person, knew that this puppet must not have been of ordinary stock, yet have his reasons not to mention his place of origin. Thus, he omitted all mention of Shakkei Pavilion, instead claiming falsely that he had found the young man while patroling Nazuchi Beach, and he bade the puppet play along so as to not expose the lie.\nBusy, bustling Tatarasuna was a place of many happy memories for the puppet. There, he was briefly human. There, he was briefly normal.\nKatsuragi, Mikoshi Nagamasa, Niwa, Miyazaki, and many other now-forgotten people from Tatarasuna would teach him to read and write, to start fires and make meals, to forge — yes, they accepted him as their friend.\nThey even asked him: \"Don't you want a name? Or are you going to let everyone out there call you the Kabukimono?\"\nYet he had no dislike for this name.\n\"Kabukimono\" referred mostly to those who wore vibrant colors and behaved in a peculiar manner. Yes, they made him different, but such was proof of his humanity — proof that he belonged in Tatarasuna.\nPity, then, that though he loved this name so, he would be forced to forsake it. For when he no longer wished to become human, it lost its meaning.\nHe would depart, and after arriving in the distant north, would join the wild banquet of the Harbingers, working to win the sixth seat among them.\nIt was the Tsaritsa who would grant him his new title — \"The Balladeer.\" Strength, power, and the desire for conflict — these he already possessed.\nThe chess pieces raised tides of madness amidst battle, and the slaughterers on the stage upended order.\nIn that moment, he was sure that The Balladeer was his true name."

The two cooperated very closely to further improve forging quality, and in the process, Akame introduced Escher to Niwa, who was also from the three Isshin traditions.\nEscher's arrival caused quite the stir for a time, for it was through his revolutionary new techniques that they were able to process Crystal Marrow in such a way that their forging efficacy and production were both increased.\nBut as time passed, anomalies emerged within the great central furnace in Tatarasuna. Black gas gathered within the furnace, and it would gradually affect the bodies of the craftspeople there. Forging and smelting were the foundations of life in Tatarasuna, but now they had become death itself.\nAnd as the toll mounted, the great furnace further went out of control. None could get close to its core, and even stopping it became nigh impossible.\nAs the highest authority at Tatarasuna, Niwa was forced to enact an information blackout while sending people to Inazuma City to beg aid from Tenshukaku.\nFor some reason, however, those who took to the sea in ships never returned. Horror began seeping into the hearts of Tatarasuna's people.\nThe Kabukimono knew that Niwa needed the Raiden Shogun's aid, but did not know that this was the very year when she had successfully built the perfect puppet using parts of herself as material, thus handing over management of the nation to the Guardian of Eternity. He thus boarded a small boat and braved storm and rain to arrive at Tenshukaku, seeking an audience with the Shogun.\nBut she now dwelled in the Plane of Euthymia, and he was repeatedly refused. In desperation, he displayed the golden feather on his person and asked to see Yae Miko instead.\nAt this time, Miko was busy assisting the Guardian, and though she rushed down as soon as she heard this news, she could only meet the distressed Kabukimono briefly. Yet he had no ears for her promises to send people to their aid immediately, and returned in despair, convinced that the Shogunate had forsaken Tatarasuna.\nStill, the dispatch was sent, the people were mobilized, and they crossed by sea. Yet they arrived to no great disaster. Indeed, most people knew nothing of what had happened. It was the mechanic, Escher, who explained that Niwa had fled with his family for fear of punishment for his malfeasance, and that the Kabukimono had gone into the core zone in his place, shutting the furnace down.\nReceiving word that the Kabukimono had been friends with the fleeing Niwa, Yae guessed at the heaviness in his heart and did not wish to further disturb him, merely sending someone to return the feather to him.\nLater still, he would disappear without a trace from Tatarasuna. But as people reminisced, they could never forget the celebratory dance he had performed together with them on the day that Mikoshi Nagamasa successfully forged his great blade.\nHis steps fluttered lightly like a feather in the wind then, and they could not have known that he, like a feather, would depart from them and journey to places unknown."

Seeing his constantly mud-caked face through the gaps in the decrepit wooden door, the Kabukimono felt something twist in his heart, as if some ancient feeling was being re-awakened. And so, he stayed within that wooden house to care for that sick boy, bringing him melons, fruits, and water to drink, helping him to wipe the filth from his face.\nMany days passed, and the child's parents did not return. It was only later that the Kabukimono learned that the parents were also workers from Tatarasuna, and they might have lived normal and happy lives, if not for husband and wife contracting some strange illness during their work, often coughing up blood as a result. That they had not returned indicated that they may have passed without any fanfare in some place out there.\nThe child's name was unimportant, for he had another identity: he was the Kabukimono's friend, and family besides. They talked about how they had been born and promised to continue to live together in that ramshackle hut. As proof of their friendship, the Kabukimono took the boy to Shakkei Pavilion to see the place where he had once lived.\nThe flaming maple leaves, the ancient latticed windows... All was as it had once been.\nAt that time, he believed that he would never return here... but he did not realize that the child could die in only one night. One night, barely enough time for the Kabukimono to go out and find some food or swipe some furniture that others no longer had any use for.\nThough he had already witnessed much change, he never knew that another person's passing was something that could occur in such a brief moment, or that this moment could grant him nothing but pain.\nAfter the shock, he felt incomparable fury. He was alone. Again. Was he not once more abandoned?\nAgain! Again! Again!\nThe boy's small body on the ground was curled up like a jumble of flower petals, a corner of it stained red with blood — red like the maple leaves... red like a blazing fire.\nThat night, a great flaming glow lit the seaside. The Kabukimono burned the wooden house, and finding himself an old straw hat from within it, left to begin his long journey.\nHe wandered everywhere, not knowing where to go, and though he would meet many more people along the way, he would never again regard any of them as his companions."

Indeed, they were yet separated by over a hundred years.\nAfter leaving Inazuma, he forsook the name Kabukimono, reverting to his nameless state, and did not even consider taking another until The Jester found him.\nIn the end, such titles as \"puppet\" or \"Kabukimono\" were all given to him by mortals. And since he would no longer have them as companions, there was no point in using the names they gave him.\nBut The Jester proved most persuasive, and the puppet was intrigued by the frenzied banquet he spoke of, and so accompanied the man to Snezhnaya to serve in the Fatui.\nA stranger named The Doctor would welcome him warmly in this frigid northern land, inviting the Wanderer to be the key reference material in his experiments — his grand research project.\nPuppet-making techniques had their roots in Khaenri'ah, and his nature as a creation of the Electro Archon made him all the more special. The Doctor was fascinated by this field of study, and, using the Wanderer as a foundational blueprint, would perform research and experiments for several decades before finally attaining the techniques that would go on to form the basis for his Segments.\nIn return, The Doctor would unlock the seal on his body, causing his abilities to greatly increase, to the point where he was a match for the lower-ranked Harbingers.\nBut even so, he did not choose another name. His colleagues called him the \"puppet,\" and so he saw himself also — a puppet, unafraid of death and inexhaustible.\nOn the Tsaritsa's orders, he would lead a company to explore the Abyss, and there he spent much time. More than once he was wounded, then repaired by The Doctor, and thus he grew stronger, surviving to be wounded again by ever mightier foes.\nMuch later, he would bring the results of his exploration back to Snezhnaya, gaining the sixth seat in the process. His orders were also changed. Instead of exploring the Abyss, he was now to constantly be on standby, assisting the clandestine activities of the Fatui across the world.\nAnd it was only then that he felt that that new name, \"The Balladeer,\" fit him."

        "Context": "The many things that happened after that might even be called soul-stirring, but for the fact that few now remember them.\nOnly those who witnessed those events would keep them as legends in their hearts, and so they continue to quietly exist, as ancient songs lost to the world.\nWithin Irminsul, The Balladeer came into contact with the \"truth\" that Lesser Lord Kusanali had placed within the flow of information. This secret had been hidden within one of The Doctor's many hearts, and just as she claimed, this truth in first person contained all his remaining honesty.\nAnd thus did The Balladeer come to know of past truths: Niwa, who had taught him how to live like an ordinary human and treated him like one, had not fled Tatarasuna to escape punishment as Escher had claimed. In fact, the true culprit had been Escher — no, The Doctor — all along. And as for the heart that had been placed within The Balladeer, it had been cut, still warm, from Niwa's breast.\nThis death had been nicely packaged within an incident at the forge, and such was Escher's silvered tongue that he all too quickly convinced everyone that this was due to the failings of the local overseer.\nAs the next person in charge, Mikoshi Nagamasa would have faced capital punishment if not for the intervention of his loyal samurai retainer, Katsuragi, who willingly took the burden of wrongdoing upon himself.\nThe tragedy that followed need not be elaborated upon. Nagamasa, unwilling as he was, had to wash the stain from the Mikoshi name, and could not allow himself to die here.\nAnd so he brought forth his beloved blade, the Daitatara Nagamasa, and struck Katsuragi down in a single blow, the blade cutting so deep that it nearly split the slain man in twain...\n...And had they not all believed in their god?\nWhy then, did they have to face such a calamity?\nIf the enigmatic puppet they called the Kabukimono had never existed, would Escher have done the same thing there?\nEven if the chance were infinitesimal, could the tragedy of Tatarasuna have been salvaged?\nAnyone anywhere else in this world would be able to do nothing about this, but not The Balladeer. He knew that he alone could attempt this one thing, here and now.\nHe believed himself bold, for he feared not death. Death was but a tiny threat to a puppet, and only humans with hearts knew horror.\nHe also knew himself to be craven, and for that he had remorse. If he had been then more like he was at present... if he had learned to be less trusting... Would those he had viewed as friends have met such a ruinous end?\nTraitor, hero, god, discarded detritus — all these identities would cease to matter to one who leaped into the flux.\nThe information flow was a place of incomparable silence, and yet his blood roiled in his ears, and his mind roared.\nEmbrace oblivion!\nThe puppet was a discarded milksop, the Kabukimono unaccomplished and sheltered, and Scaramouche was a schemer — one who eventually went against divine decree, seeking to go against the tides of the world.\nBut what of it?\nOnce upon a time, these inhuman hands had shut a great blazing furnace without caring if his ten fingers were burned to a crisp.\nNow, these hands grasped at the tiniest possibility, twisting the truth to fulfill his wish.\nYes, embrace it, embrace it with this form that shall be obliterated!\nTo ruin with this life, as worthless as flowers and feathers and the dawn dew!\nFarewell, world! The future shall be what it will. Farewell nonetheless!"

        "Title": "Tiny Doll",
        "Context": "Having decided to stop by Sumeru, the Wanderer took some time off to visit Treasures Street and learn how to make toys from some of the merchants there.\nIn a corner of the bustling street, a kind-hearted old fellow with hair as white as snow invited him to sit by his side, teaching him how to use cloth and thread to sew that which he wanted to make step by step.\nThe Wanderer spent much time practicing, doing this thing that did not agree with his personality. Strange, perhaps, but he did not hate it.\nHe had done such things with great patience in times past, after all, learning things such as holding cutlery, wearing clothes, combing his hair...\nYes, he had learned to be a \"human\" from the little things up.\nA few days later, his great work was complete — a little man with white clothes and black hair, a waistband tied using a butterfly knot, and a clear, round tear at the corner of his eye.\nIndeed, back then, there was a young fellow who had made this doll in imitation of the Wanderer's past appearance. Shame, then, that he had burned both the doll and his old home to ashes when he left Inazuma.\nMany years later, he would make one as well, and oh, how familiar that felt!\nSmall and soft as it was, it was akin to a defenseless babe. It took up little space in his sleeves, and if he kept it in his hat, it felt like having a travel companion.\n\"From today, you shall wander together with me.\"\nHe said softly, placing it in his pocket."

        "Title": "Vision",
        "Context": "In that instant, the Wanderer could hear the wind's voice. He knew not whence it had come, only that it changed direction as if to greet him.\nOn it were scents old and nostalgic — the iron hammer, metals, the furnace, the dust of the earth...\nDistant dreams, a prosperous past... Incredible though it might seem, even he once led such a simple life.\nIn that instant, he beheld his own reflections, each one vivid, each one real, each one him.\nCowering in fear, pathetic in his agony, arrogant yet laughable... And they all coalesced into one body.\nTo accept the past is to acknowledge its failings, to recognize that one is naught but a coward who has achieved nothing — who has nothing.\nBut only by doing so could he break free of his shackles and become, once again, that tragic person.\nIn that moment, he knew this: that the appearances of peace and beauty were but an illusion. The real him had never died, no, it lived on deep within his heart. As long as he still had a choice, he would tread the same course no matter how many times he did this over.\nAs he moved like lightning itself, a blazing light came between him and the Everlasting Lord of Arcane Wisdom, blocking its attack. His will and his choice had gained him the eye of the gods.\nThe Vision descended, and caught between bright light and darkness, the glittering ornament seemed almost like an eye on a smiling face, questioning him from afar: Can you, who have desires of such intensity, still be considered a being without a heart?"
