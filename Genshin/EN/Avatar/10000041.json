Well, if you've ever had a look inside her lab, then know that the big pile of astrology-related apparatus and tools in there didn't come out of thin air.\nIn fact, all of them come with a hefty price tag — books from Liyue, an astrolabe from Sumeru... The shipping fees alone are impressive.\nThat Mona should be in abject poverty comes, therefore, as no surprise.\nIn order to support herself, Mona eventually took up a commercial contract — her contributions to a column about constellations in The Steambird have become her most stable income source.\nNow having a monthly income, Mona could have left her life of poverty. But how could an astrologist's pursuit of knowledge end here?\nWhenever she gets paid, Mona will immediately shell out on more astrology-related resources, returning to a state of destitution once more.\nThis process plays out every month.\nToday, too, is another day Mona worries over Mora."

Which of these descriptions is accurate?\"\nAlbedo could not help but ask this question — and when he did, Mona promptly realized that she had never given it much thought herself.\nStroking her chin, she pondered this paradox deeply for a moment, before responding:\n\"Hmph.

Academic quotations, dense footnotes and even the occasional hand-drawn star maps abounded in these writings.\nThe editor-in-chief could not help but feel worried that this approach was too academic.
