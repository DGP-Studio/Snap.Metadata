        "Context": "The novel series \"Flowers for Princess Fischl\" is available as a collectible set.\nDue to the tiny numbers in circulation, it is a priceless commodity amongst loyal fans of the author.\nBut no matter how elegant these works are aesthetically, their worldview remains incredibly bleak:\nEvery good, bright and noble thing must eventually fall to inexorable entropic destruction, and the final destination of the universe is the realm-in-waiting of the Prinzessin, Immernachtreich.\nThis is the fate of all worlds, of the universe, and all who live in it.\nAnd the Prinzessin and her loyal companion, the \"Night-Severing Raven Oz,\" Ozvaldo Hrafnavins, are the World Beasts who will swallow all dreams.\nAt the very end, at the end of karma itself, she will grant all the gathered souls her benediction, and use her Thundering Retribution to cleanse all that is ugly and wicked.\nThe Prinzessin will then set her own heart ablaze, and the universe shall be born anew in its immortal light.\nBut before all this can come to pass, the Prinzessin must first roam many universes, and see countless new sights.\nThus it is perfectly within the spirit of the original work that the Prinzessin should be stuck as an investigator for the Adventurers' Guild in a slightly backward world. Just a little twist of fate, nothing more.\nThe Prinzessin will come to understand someday that each moment of her life, no matter how insignificant their little twists could be, is to be treasured.\nAfter all, the Prinzessin's very own Phantasmagoria is made out of ones such as these."

This is the first time little ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà has met a friend she can bring over for dinner since she turned fourteen. This is a special occasion.\"\n\"W‚ÄîWhat are you saying! I... One does not simply cavort with the plebeians!\"\n‚ÄîAnd that's what happened.\nFor all intents and purposes, it seems that the Kaiser und Kaiserin der Verurteilung could both see Oz, and both believed Oz to be the Prinzessin's first friend.\nAs for the \"Adventurer Who Bears the World's Curses,\" the \"Visitor From Outer Worlds\" and the \"Strange Fae-shaped Emergency Sustenance...\"\nThey would become the Prinzessin's new friends, though that would happen even further in the future."
