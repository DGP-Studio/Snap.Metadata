This has also meant that the mountainous piles of paperwork from the various departments and bureaus in Liyue have fallen upon Ganyu's shoulders. But though her workload has increased seven, a hundred, or even a thousandfold, her sense of responsibility has never wavered.

Under pressure, her nervousness does result in the occasional error.\nOne such incident occurred during the Rite of Descension, without doubt the most important annual event in Liyue's calendar.\nGanyu was three minutes late for the Rite and had to squeeze through the crowd in full view of all.\nLater on, with a face as red as a tomato, she stammered her way through an unconvincing explanation, all the while apologizing profusely to Rex Lapis in her heart.\nHer colleagues guessed that there must be some reason for the mistake.\nThose who did not know her well saw that Rex Lapis did not mind, and thus paid the incident no attention.\nThose closer to her worried in private, and asked if she needed a workload adjustment or a short vacation, but Ganyu refused.\n\"I spent two hours making sure that I wasn't wearing anything too similar to last year's Rite...\"\nNeedless to say, Ganyu was not about to admit to this being the real reason for her tardiness!"

Even the raucous dancing of hilichurls will fail to wake her.\nThese habits were at first just a running joke within the Liyue Qixing.\nBut once, after accompanying the then-Tianxuan to lunch outside the city, a well-fed Ganyu simply crawled into the nearest roadside haystack. She ended up being transported all the way to Dihua Marsh, awakening only after bumping her head during the unloading.\nUnable to find Ganyu anywhere over the subsequent three hours, and knowing that she would not depart unannounced, the Tianxuan almost filed a missing person report.\nAfter receiving a stern admonishment to \"only take afternoon naps where it's safe,\" Ganyu retorted:\n\"Well... isn't everywhere in Liyue safe?\"\nPerhaps, with the mixture of human and illuminated beast blood flowing through her veins, Ganyu's understanding of the world's affairs is a little different to that of most humans."

For Ganyu, the difficulty of such a challenge is second only to finding a Flaming Flower atop Dragonspine.\nBut she is not one to give up half-way through the ascent.\nDuring the Archon War, she once choked a giant monster to death with ease after getting lodged in its throat when it tried to eat her, said monster having fatally underestimated quite how wide her waistline was.\nFor Ganyu, avoiding any similarly embarrassing episodes in the future is an absolute must."

Yet when a wicked beast from the sea arose and threatened the land beneath their feet, that peaceful life ceased to be an option. Three thousand years ago, Ganyu answered the call of Morax the God of Geo, aiding him in the Archon Wars. And when the war was over, she chose to stay in Liyue and help the humans build a better polity there.

The moment she made that decision, a Vision appeared at her hip, granting her power to resonate with the world to a degree beyond her natural abilities. Whether she would grow strong enough to no longer need it, or whether she would use it as a last resort in Liyue's defense... Regardless, she chose to serve as the bridge between adepti and humans.
