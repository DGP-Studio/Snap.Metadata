This will also briefly <color=#99FF88FF>apply Dendro</color> to Kirara. The shield will absorb <color=#99FF88FF>Dendro DMG</color> with 250% effectiveness. The shield's DMG absorption will be based on Kirara's Max HP and will not exceed a certain percentage of that Max HP. The remaining DMG absorption on a Shield of Safe Transport will stack on a new one when it is created, and its duration will reset.\n\n<color=#FFD780FF>Hold</color>\nOut of her desire to \"deliver within half a day,\" Kirara deploys a Shield of Safe Transport identical to the one that can be created by {LAYOUT_MOBILE#tapping}{LAYOUT_PC#pressing}{LAYOUT_PS#pressing} the skill. She will also curl up into a special express delivery box, entering the Urgent Neko Parcel state in order to move and fight more swiftly.\n\n<color=#FFD780FF>Urgent Neko Parcel</color>\n· Deals <color=#99FF88FF>Dendro DMG</color> to opponents she crashes into. This effect can be triggered once on each opponent every 0.5s.\n· When in this state, Kirara's movement speed, climbing speed, and jumping power are all increased, and her Stamina Consumption from climbing is increased.\n· When the duration ends or the skill is used again, a Flipclaw Strike more powerful than the attack in the {LAYOUT_MOBILE#Tap}{LAYOUT_PC#Press}{LAYOUT_PS#Press} Mode will be unleashed, dealing <color=#99FF88FF>AoE Dendro DMG</color>.\n· The Urgent Neko Parcel state lasts a maximum of 10s. When the state ends, the skill will enter CD. The longer Kirara spends in this state, the longer the CD will be.\n· Sprinting or actively canceling climbing will end this state early.\n\n<i>\"So you wanna know the secret to speedy deliveries?

After you thank her for delivering your package, she will bow deeply while wearing an expression of unadulterated bliss, as though she was the one receiving the gift.\nIf you're willing to spend the time to leave a 5-star rating on the feedback board or give her a few snacks, you may even see stars of joy shoot from this youkai's eyes as her tails swish back and forth.\nAh! But the same people who tell you this will also warn you that this nekomata isn't some weak little thing you can pick on. If you have designs on packages that don't belong to you or get carried away and try to touch her tails... Well, then you'll have to face the consequences.\nAfter hearing all this, it's hard to resist going to Komaniya Express...\n\"Excuse me, I have a package to deliver, and I was hoping the neko—\"\nWithout waiting for you to finish, the owner turns around and shouts \"Kirara! Another one for you!\" as though it were an everyday occurrence.\nAt that moment, a beaming girl will bound towards you, quickly fix her hair and adjust her clothes, and say with a smile—\n\"Welcome, and thank you for choosing Komaniya Express!\""

        "Context": "Kirara's earliest memories are of wandering the wilds of Inazuma.\nBack then, she was a nameless kitten with but one tail, and woke every morning with an empty, growling stomach. After a stretch, a yawn, and a single \"meow\" as though to bellyache about her circumstances, she would begin to hunt for breakfast. The menu often included finches that had let down their guard, or overly curious young fish too near the shore.\nWhenever she encountered adventurers out in the wilderness, she would lie down at a safe distance and watch intently as they fished out all kinds of marvelous instruments from their packs. Fwoosh! Suddenly there was a fire roaring. Bong! A strange cauldron was set over the fire. And then, with a bubbling sound, an intoxicating scent would occasionally waft over on the breeze...\nObserving this process with wide eyes, to her it was as if she had witnessed magic. Thus a yearning for human society began to flutter about in her chest, as though a butterfly had flown into her heart.\nDuring a frigid winter night with the biting winds howling, Kirara, still a small kitten, was frozen to the point of being unable to feel her tail.\n\"Gotta find a warm place to hide. Even a hollow in a tree will do...\" She thought to herself. But when she was able to look up, she saw a cluster of warm lights flickering not too far away...\nThis was the first time Kirara entered a human home, and while she was curious about everything around her, she was also frightened. The owner of the house seemed not to notice the kitten that had found its way into her home, but Kirara paid little notice. She found a small square box near the entryway into which she snugly fit, and into it did she sit, falling asleep almost immediately.\n\"I'll just rest the night, just one night...\" were her last thoughts before dreams took her...\nYet when she awoke, she found a warm fire crackled away next to her, and beside it was a fragrant bowl of nekomanma. Directly across from her was an old lady in the middle of knitting a woolen sweater. The old lady seemed to be trying to say something, as though encouraging her to eat. With her tail down and guard raised, she cautiously took a bite of that aromatic nekomanma in front of her that she was so curious about...\nIt was the most delicious thing she had ever eaten, to the point she began to doubt whether or not she was still dreaming!\nAnd so, she stayed in that cozy little home for one winter after another, and heard story after story from that kind old woman...\nOn occasion, when Kirara thinks back to that first night, she'll cock her head and ask herself:\n\"Strange... what was I thinking about before I fell asleep again...?\""

        "Context": "Kirara enjoys human cities, with their fireworks, marketplaces and scattered eaves. There is always something she's never seen before, waiting to be discovered.\nWhen she first became a nekomata, she used her youkai powers to enter Inazuma City in a human form. She eagerly explored every nook and cranny in the city, and not even the roof of the Almighty Shogun's Tenshukaku was immune from her curiosity. This is the reason that the Tenryou Commission is one of the addresses she is most familiar with.\nThough the Tenryou Commission taught her rules like \"don't climb on other people's roofs\" and \"don't eat the ornamental koi\", then she learned \"how to be a good youkai in human society\" from none other than the Lady Kitsune of the Grand Narukami Shrine. Kirara has caught the eye of \"the greatest and coolest youkai,\" as she calls her, and Yae Miko, for her part, has been willing to impart all her experience upon her lively and interesting junior. Upon learning that Kirara felt the streets and alleys of Inazuma City were priceless treasures, Miko recommended that she seek employment at Komaniya Express.\n\"If you want to blend into human society, then you must work like an ordinary human. This is most important.\" Thus spoke the Lady Kitsune.\n\"Ah, yes,\" the illustrious priestess appended, \"Packages addressed to Guuji Yae at the Grand Narukami Shrine must be given the utmost priority. This is even more paramount than what I just said before!\""

Hiding beside the paths that the deliveries must take, they carefully eye the passing couriers.\nIf the delivery person looks tough, or is in a group, the bandits won't risk it. After all, it's just another day with an empty stomach at most.\nBut when they chance upon a courier like Kirara, appearing delicate and traveling alone, their hearts leap with joy and anticipation. They can nearly taste the Mora that has fallen neatly into their laps.\nWhen Kirara passes, the bandits emerge from concealment and surround her, maliciously blocking her way forward.\n\"Huh? Do you need something?\" Kirara stops uncertainly.\nUpon closer inspection, this young lady has two tails. Strange, to be sure, but she looks frail and her face is kind — the perfect prey, through and through. Even better, the pack she carries is bursting with thick packages. Truly, this is a good day for a robbery!\n\"Uhm... If you have packages you'd like to deliver, please visit our Inazuma City offi—\"\nMost bandits don't even let her finish before brandishing their blades. The more polite sort will attempt to persuade her to put down her delivery pack willingly for her own safety. The desperate will simply swarm her, hands outstretched to plunder.\nBut whatever their methods, the result is always the same—\nThe next morning, several large boxes will have appeared on the doorstep of the Tenryou Commission. Under the \"Type of Goods Delivered\" section of the delivery slip sealing the packages, a single word will be written: \"Meanies.\""

So this is how human girls dress...\" Her wish to join human society made her very conscious of her own outfit, and whether or not it was similar to those around her.\nIn the springtime, girls would often pluck a flower to place behind their ear or in their hair... Soon after, a special accessory became quite popular... Then everyone began flocking to some particular style of bracelet...\nKirara accepted every style without question, imitating every trend as she saw it. She never thought there was anything wrong with what she was doing, just that all those accessories would occasionally restrict her movement and make it hard to climb up and down. It was so different from being a kitten out in the countryside!\nThis persisted one day, when she was delivering a package to an old customer named Chiori, and she received a serious dressing down...\nAt the time, Kirara had politely knocked on the door before gently pushing her way inside. But she couldn't have known that Chiori would glare at Kirara as though she were a cat that had fallen into a bucket of paints...\nThis Inazuman fashion designer who had opened a famous design label in Fontaine was already quite familiar with Kirara, and so she spoke directly—\n\"Utter insanity! What did you do on the way here? Fight Specters? What kind of garbage have you covered yourself in? How did that garish flower get stuck in your hair? It's assaulting my eyeballs. Really, the only thing on your entire body with a speck of taste is those shoes...\"\n\"Um, Chiori, y—you know th—those are just m—my feet...\" Kirara managed to stammer nervously.\nChiori buried her face in her hands, and immediately picked up her scissors and some cloth before pulling Kirara into a changing room.\n\"Now don't you misunderstand! It's just that I'd be embarrassed to let anyone see you walking out of my shop looking like THAT!\"\nThe dressing down became a dressing up, and after the sound of snapping scissors and swift needlework faded to silence, Kirara had the outfit she now wears today.\nFrom then on, she had a new task when delivering packages: answering client's questions about just where she got that delightful outfit. Thus did the reputation of Chiori's shop spread far and wide.\n\"Hmph. I told you my judgment was immaculate.\" On this delivery run to Fontaine, Kirara found her friend in seemingly much better spirits.\n\"Other than the clothing orders, is there anything else?\" Inquired Chiori.\n\"Yes, there is, it's just that...\"\n\"Come on, out with it, stop beating around the bush!\"\n\"The customers are asking... if you, that is, your shop... Can you release a shoe design that looks like a cat's paw pads?\""

Each package takes her to different places, and allows her to see all kinds of scenery.\nAfter work, Kirara would go to the \"Undelivered Packages\" section of the warehouse, and see all the myriad reasons that packages couldn't be delivered to their recipients.\n\"Filled in wrong address,\" \"recipient moved,\" \"wrong name\"...\nEach stranded package was like a fish bone lodged in her throat, choking her slowly. Thus, she began to quietly record the details of each package, and used her routes during work and spare time to discover the whereabouts of each recipient.\nThis resulted in the reputation of Komaniya Express increasing by the day, as customers rushed to praise the reliability and quality of their service: No package was undeliverable.\nWhen the owner of Komaniya Express heard of this, they spent all night designing a new title to issue to Kirara: Gold Level Courier.\n\"Actually, when I saw that the 'Undelivered Packages' section was empty, I thought we'd been robbed...\" confided the owner.\nFor Kirara, her greatest happiness is the moment she delivers a package into the hands of the recipient. After a long day making deliveries, she likes to climb to a high place, taking in the sights of the city while listening to the sounds of mirth drifting upward from the markets.\nThis is when she recalls her days as a kitten, listening to stories on the lap of that old lady. The twists and turns and sudden reveals, the fantastic beasts and monsters, all gently follow Kirara's memories like the cool evening breeze, blowing gently into her heart.\nAnd just like the old days, she gently closes her eyes as the stories intermingle with her dreams, welcoming the arrival of tomorrow with contentment."

        "Context": "Some clients of Komaniya Express may be surprised to discover a mysterious package at their door. Most of these packages are small and exquisite, and beautifully decorated.\nCupping the parcel in their hands and shaking their heads, they might think it strange, as they haven't bought anything recently, nor is there any writing on the package. But they may have already forgotten that in the not-too-distant past, they gave some snacks to that courier with two tails.\nEach package usually contains a lovely little gift, such as a dried flower of the Nilotpala Lotus, a Starconch ornament, or if the household has young children, a Scarab with peculiar patterns on its shell!\nThese are all items that Kirara has collected while out on her deliveries. To her, each is a novel and fascinating treasure, and perfect as thank-you gifts. Unfortunately, the rules of Komaniya Express forbid any transactions between employees and clients. Thus, Kirara must make each small box herself, adding cute decorations, and quietly placing them on the recipients' doorsteps.\nHowever, the beneficiary of by far the most \"mystery packages\" is a small home in the Inazuman countryside...\nThough Kirara is quick to say she never wants to go back being some \"great youkai\" roaming the mountains and valleys, whenever she has time, she will always run back to that old house from that frigid winter's night. Leaving a present at the door, if she happens to find the old woman sunning herself in the yard, she'll immediately return to being a cat. \"Meow, meow,\" she'll call, jumping up onto the woman's knees, curling up into a ball and pouting for attention.\n\"Ah! Back, are we, Kirara?\" The old woman smiles and laughs. She doesn't know that this little cat is already a renowned courier. All she knows is that she often goes out to \"play\" for ever longer periods.\n\"You really are growing up so fast. I remember when I found you in the box, you were such a tiny little thing...\" Scratching Kirara's head, the old woman fishes out a round, shimmering pearl and places it on her paw pads.\n\"See? This is that Sango Pearl from the story. Now, I don't know who it's from, but there it was on the doorstep, along with some snacks, too.\" The old woman also quietly observes to herself: \"When I wake up, the house is so clean and orderly, and breakfast is already prepared. How very odd...\"\n\"Why, you haven't grown into a youkai who takes care of me in my old age, have you, little cat?\"\nWhenever Kirara hears this, she stretches innocently, letting out a contented yawn as she pretends to have no idea what the old woman is saying.\nAfter speaking, the old woman falls silent and just smiles warmly. The two of them then continue to enjoy a leisurely afternoon bathed in sunshine."

        "Context": "One night in the depths of midwinter, Kirara was lying down by the coals, taking a nap. But try as she might, she simply couldn't sleep well.\nThe charcoal had long burned out, and even the smoldering embers had gasped their final breath as the chill wind rattled in through cracks in window frames and seeped under the doors. Kirara involuntarily curled up tightly, hugging her tail close. Lately, her tail was always itchy and restless, and no matter how much she licked it, it was never enough to calm it.\n\"Strange, Granny left this morning, she's been gone way too long...\" she quietly mewed to herself.\nThe final lingering ember became darkened ash, and even the residual warmth it had provided was snuffed out. Kirara stretched out and looked out uneasily at the snowflakes falling outside the house, and then quietly leaped out the window.\nThe snowflakes under her feet were chilly, and her paw pads soon ached from the cold. Climbing onto the roof, she gazed out towards the city. But the moon was totally obscured this night, and the surroundings were pitch black without even a speck of light.\n\"I remember there was a really, really tall tree nearby...\"\nKirara's tail seemed even more anxious than she was. As she climbed, it repeatedly refused to obey her mental commands and nearly caused her to fall.\nThe tree stretched ever upward, so tall it seemed without end. Kirara did not think about just how high she had climbed. Instead, stories of youkai and humans raced across her mind. It seemed as if she wasn't climbing a tree but pursuing days gone by, and if she was but a step too slow, all might slip away forever...\n\"Faster, just a bit faster...\"\nFinally, she reached the crown of the tree, and all the world lay spread beneath her. In the distance, a dazzling light suddenly lit the blackness before her eyes like a firefly — the light from the city at night.\nIn that moment, it was as if something dormant in Kirara's heart was ignited, and all the fantastical stories of the past had finally become reality, a thousand rays of shimmering light streaming into that galaxy of fireworks. The stories that had once seemed so far away were now so close she could almost reach out and touch them, and she now yearned as never before to bask in that glow.\n\"Ah! I see her!\"\nSomehow, an unseen power helped Kirara pick out the one person she desired to see amongst the dazzling stream of lights.\nWhen she safely alighted back on the ground, the clouds parted and the moonlight cast her shadow upon the snow, a shadow that now boasted two tails...\n\"Are you sure you don't want to stay the night? The snow has only just stopped, and getting back won't be easy,\" urged the landlord.\n\"No, no, I couldn't! I have a little cat at home, waiting for my return, haha...\" laughed the old woman as she stood before the entryway.\n\"If that's the case, I'll take you back!\" A young female voice suddenly rang out from outside.\nThe landlord and old woman peered outside, and there they saw a youthful lady with two restless tails, and a shining Vision dangling from her waist."
