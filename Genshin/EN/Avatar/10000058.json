Well, I did ask him to write on this topic, yes, but isn't this the hot genre of the day?\"\nFaced with the editor's doubtful gaze, Miko gave her opinion forthrightly: that a book that should have been interesting yet was shackled at every turn by the topic was, simply put, \"not free enough.\"\nThings like \"top sellers,\" \"genre fiction,\" these were naught but fads that would come and go every decade.\nGetting with the times was a shortcut, yes, but if a work had the quality that could surmount this tide, why go with the flow nonetheless?\n\"Pass this message to this new author of ours: tell him that there's no need to bother about genre. He just needs to write his story and write it well.\"\nUpon hearing this, the author stopped writing for a time, as if suddenly having an epiphany.

It's too normal for a book like this.\"\n\"Huh, so that was what you were concerned about... No, uh, never mind.

As the years fly by, boredom becomes the greatest foe.\nAnd if even she were, archon-forbid, one day to accept sitting quietly still, obstinate as deadwood, would the world now sorely lack for another clever person adept at discovering fun and grasping opportunity?\nAs such, looking for fun things to do in every nook and cranny can only be the most reasonable and necessary course.\nAnd if she were to, say, utilize her authority as Guuji in making fun things happen — why, some things are unavoidable, are they not?\nOn the day of the festival, Guuji Yae would nod in satisfaction as she received a delivery of fireworks from the Yashiro Commission — of Naganohara construction and specially-made to boot.\nThat night's ceremony was, of course, performed with perfect respect to all etiquette and rites.\nThe sight of the \"Lady Guuji\" kneeling gracefully the whole night through would be the object of awe for all the other shrine maidens.\nIn the meantime, she would sit beneath the meteor shower of light adorning the skies, watching the festival-goers as they came and went.\nAnd the din of the fireworks covered the mumbling that came between teeth chewing on a candy apple.\n\"You know, when you asked me to become Guuji, you never mentioned that I'd only ever be able to sneak outside to watch the festivities from then on.\""

Thus this action seemed a sacrifice greater than the reward — hardly a wise decision.\nSome others said that the Guuji suspected something to be wrong with the whole situation, and now that the list of those involved was so extensive, any major shakeup in the Yashiro Commission could destabilize Inazuma itself.\nThis thought, too, seemed reasonable on face, yet did not stand up to scrutiny.

Do not forget this in the days that follow.\"\nThese words would serve as a seed of destiny, foreshadowing the Yashiro Commission's future position.\nIn some other time, if a storm were to descend upon Inazuma, and even if they were to come into conflict with the other two commissions, the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan would remember the favor they were shown and abide the Shogun's path to Eternity.\nThis was a move that the Guuji played with no regrets whatsoever."

It's not like the fire brigade has ever gotten a year-end bonus or anything.\"\nAs such, after some preparation, the Fire-Soothing Festival of that year would be changed to no longer feature dancing shrine maidens but a grand, rollicking light novel submission contest.\nThe organizing body for this competition and any subsequent publications, the \"Yae Publishing House,\" would also \"borrow\" the Fire-Soothing Festival Committee's budget.\nAs for the profits? Into the shrine's coffers they went.\n\"Well, we no longer have many fires, and yet our budget keeps increasing. Thus, this restructuring relieves the financial burden placed upon the people.\"\n\"Also, the study of lore and the writing of literature and poetry is also a way of pleasing our Archon — surely you do not claim to know more of ritual and ceremony than I?\"\nThat was what Yae Miko said most solemnly to Kujou Takayuki when he came by unannounced.\nThe Tenryou Commissioner was ultimately forced to leave the way he came, stormy-faced, along with his attendants.\nLittle did any of them know that the moment they stepped out of the shrine, the somber Lady Miko would pluck a novel manuscript from the nearby offering box and continue annotating it."

In time, even the Guuji began to falter, and the enemy seized that opening, lashing out with great force!\"\n\"Just then, a bolt of lightning descended like a falling star before the Guuji — a glimmering Vision!\"\n\"Grasping it in her hand, the revivified Guuji showed forth her power and...\"\n\"Now wait just a minute! None of what you just said happened, right?\"\n\"Hmm? Well, how about this then? It all started the day when I had a most vicious \"Ramen Duel\" down in Hanamizaka...\n\"Oh, come on! Nobody's ever gotten a Vision from eating ramen!\"\n\"But wouldn't that be interesting? I mean, these are the sorts of stories you like to hear, right?\"\nYae Miko gave a thin, enigmatic smile as she was faced with the traveler's curiosity.\n\"After all, would you believe me if I said that 'my Vision is purely ornamental, just for show,' little one? Hardly — not even if it were the truth.\""
