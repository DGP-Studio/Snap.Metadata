Even in an era of relative safety on the roads such as this, any one escort run could involve any number of variables.\nPerhaps this employer might change the route on an ad hoc basis, or perhaps that customer will nitpick and refuse to accept the goods, never mind how the roads do not lack for all manner of petty crooks if one is fortunate, and big-time bandits if one is not.\nAlthough the Sword and Strongbox Secure Transport Agency has no shortage of capable, skilled staff, were you to comb through all their roster, the only one among their ranks who can keep clients happy while beating any brigands down is Gaming.\nThe merchant guilds, for their part, are quite eager to have this young, competent guard to escort their cargo, and Gaming is no less popular on the streets outside of work than he is in his professional capacity. Indeed, any and all friends of this busy fellow will rate him two thumbs up.\n\"It was a piece of cake! Come see our Wushou Dance when you're free!

With his parents working together, their business was getting better by the day, and of course, any father would hope for his son to succeed him in the family business.\nThanks to his father's hard work, at least Gaming no longer had to experience the backbreaking daily grind of farm work, nor would he have to start a business from scratch. But as they say, \"like father, like son\" — Gaming turned out to have his own ideas about which road to tread, just as his father had chosen to diverge from Gaming's grandfather's decision to keep growing tea.\nThe two were at an impasse, with neither accepting the other's view. Only Gaming's eventual departure from their home put a stop to the arguments between father and son.\nFor his next haunt, Gaming chose the bustling Yilong Wharf, having planned out how he'd make his living a while back — through a passion of his that had burned since childhood, Wushou Dance, of course.\nFilled with enthusiasm and confidence that created complacency, the young man blazed through creating all the relevant props, even printing flyers introducing himself and booking performance venues... He planned to plant his feet first in Yilong Wharf, then conquer Liyue Harbor, and finally, to introduce Wushou Dance to Teyvat at large...\nSuffice it to say that the diligent youth's passionate pursuit of his dream sent all of the business startup funds he had saved up before leaving home up in smoke, leaving him quite broke in short order.\n\"Making Wushou Dance your career? As if! Forget making a living, hah, you'd be lucky not to starve!\"\nHungry as he was, Gaming now understood his father's words.\nWith the mindset \"What's done is done, let's focus on getting a meal first,\" Gaming had little choice but to find a job that could put food on his table.\nFortunately, fate has a habit of giving right after taking. Lantern Rite was just around the corner at the time, and the good-hearted young man led a Fontainian merchant to the Sword and Strongbox Secure Transport Agency just as a lead guard was fretting over a manpower shortage. Gaming took the opportunity to recommend himself and was promptly taken on as a temp employee.\nThanks to his daily Wushou Dance training, he had a strong foundation in martial arts and tenacity in the face of hardship, and was promptly asked to stay on as an official guard for hire after finishing that escort run.\nAll in all, that definitely counted as feeding himself through Wushou Dance... right? That was how Gaming saw it, anyway."

How would I ever get stuck in jam? And how would dipping even help in that situation?\"\nAnd whenever the other party gets confused, Gaming will try supplementing his explanation through different methods, complete with various gesticulations to demonstrate his point.\nThis manner of speaking, he explains, he got from his mother, who married into Qiaoying Village from afar, and to whom he was quite attached after his birth. He would follow her just about everywhere, and in his doings and interactions with others, he would pick up many of her habits and interests.\nNothing to do? Get some dim sum. Feeling hot and woozy? Brew up some cooling tea. Eating a meal? Got to have some greens... and no, melons and fruits are not greens.\nThese habits are not ironclad, of course. If a friend came up with some new suggestion, he would be game to try it out. People from all lands were brethren, after all, and it is Gaming's way to treat all with sincerity.\nHe can easily shoot the breeze with just about anyone in Yilong Wharf, young or old. At first, most think his polite speech to just be pretty pleasantries, but after some time, they will find that he is being perfectly earnest. He will introduce the itinerant handyman Duqin to work opportunities, assist the ever-busy Zhigui, fetch medicinal wines from Liyue Harbor for his fellow guards, and even get Dip Yeuk to give a Suanni-themed toy to a child whom he himself has never met, all because Dip once mentioned that the boy liked watching Wushou Dance...\nPriceless is the friend who knows your heart, and so everyone returns the favor to this big-hearted lad. They always invite him to come in and rest his feet when he comes by with a delivery, and there is always a seat for him at a dim sum table — well, on the condition that he doesn't say \"I'll foot the bill.\"\nGaming often claims that he'd never have gotten far in Yilong Wharf without everyone's help, but those familiar with the humble, earnest lad know that he would have been fine no matter where he was."

As such, no matter how busy work gets at the transport agency, Gaming will take time to train.\nAt meals, Gaming may be found tussling cheekily with his colleagues over dishes, wielding his chopsticks like a seasoned duelist, while under the table his knees are bent in a low horse stance, sturdy as a mountain. After the cargo is packed, he will rarely get a cart to move it to a warehouse but instead will lift it all himself, box by box, to train his arm strength.\nThe lead guard knew that their work was hard and laborious, and so from time to time would call for suggestions on items that might be added to the office for relaxation purposes.\nSoft beds, comfortable pillows, Genius Invokation TCG decks...\nAt that moment, Gaming cleared his throat and said: \"If possible, could we have some Plum Blossom Poles installed in the front yard so we can train better? Bet if we firm up our fundamentals, it'll make our work a whole lot easier!\"\nHis words were met with silence. Everyone was just discussing where to go after work, and here was someone saying that overtime was the best break. Why, this was a crime most heinous, and \"punishment\" was in order! So they gathered about him like bees in a hive, some \"screeching,\" others \"pleading,\" still others pretending to \"advise\" him, laughing and cavorting.\n\"Have mercy on me and accept my apologies, brothers, and thank you for giving me my minute of glory. How about this, then? How about I treat you all to some dim sum? Will that make amends?\"\nThis sort of horsing about happened every so often among the guards, of course. Everyone knew that Gaming wanted the Plum Blossom Pillars for Wushou Dance practice, and everyone was just playing along with him, wagging their tongues and fingers and feigning their reactions so his birthday surprise wouldn't be spoiled. In truth, they had already stacked those pillars up outside — all that remained was for them to put them up together.\nDuring their downtime, Gaming also often invites his fellow guards to take up Wushou Dance, and everyone has indeed tried it at least once on account of it \"looking totally dope,\" though almost none have persevered for long, with one of them even joking that:\n\"If we put suffering on a podium, we guards would get bronze, Wushou Dance masters silver, and Gaming would get gold, since he does both!\"\nNot wrong, in truth."

He's a mature and decent sort, and having left his home, he has earned his status and reputation without relying on anyone else.\nOnly those aunts and uncles who saw him grow up know that he was once the notorious \"demon king\" of Qiaoying Village.\nIf he wasn't climbing up the roof tiles, he was grabbing at the bird nests in trees, and he would go into the fields with the adults to harvest tea, to the point where his father paying damages to the neighbors for those incidents was practically routine.\nIn truth, however, he climbed up the house beams to help his father store a private stash of Mora, and he rummaged through bird nests to help his mother collect feathers for head ornaments, and he was thrashing in the fields trying to capture pests and harmful bugs...\nAs an oddball, Gaming's head is always full of strange, bright new ideas, leaving others quite dumbfounded, and so his parents only ever spoiled him more despite his mischievousness.\nHaving heard that a somewhat famous Wushou Dance troupe from Yilong Wharf would be performing in Qiaoying Village, his father had handed work over to his assistants long beforehand, preparing to get Gaming one of the best seats to the watch the spectacular show.\nBut on the day of the dance itself, he tarried too long at the tea table as he dined on dim sum with his friends, and by the time Gaming had pulled both parents before the stage, it had already been ringed by spectators thrice and thrice again. There would be no watching the Wushou Dance today, it seemed.\n\"Daddy's a cheat and a fibber! You said we'd go see the big Suanni!\"\nThere was no comforting him by this point. Even attempts to placate him with promises of purchasing toys were drowned out by his cries.\n\"Little kids who don't listen to their parents will get eaten by the Suanni! Check out how fierce it is!\"\nSo saying, Gaming's father lifted the boy atop his shoulders. At that moment, the Suanni onstage leapt onto a tall pillar, and it turned and looked, locking eyes with Gaming.\nAll at once the boy stopped crying, staring with wide eyes and open mouth at the dance taking place onstage. After the show had ended and the crowd dispersed, Gaming continued to gaze back in the direction of the stage the whole way home. Only then did his parents see that something was amiss. Could he have been frightened so by the words spoken previously?\n\"Ah, Gaming, no need to be scared. That wasn't a real Suanni! There were people inside, and they don't eat children...\"\n\"Daddy! I wanna watch the show again! I wanna be like that big Suanni. Raaaarr!\"\nFrom that day forth, Gaming, once whimsical (some might say half-hearted) in all his fancies, became utterly consumed with Wushou Dance, often badgering his father to take him to see shows, and his indiscriminate mischief-making gradually turned to (what he thought was) meticulous and well-planned Wushou Dance training.\nAt least eight bamboo baskets became casualties of his road to mastery in lifting the beast's head, cruelly felled by kicks.\nAs for the various rice and soup spoons that went missing around the house, they were no doubt taken to be used for drum practice, dragging not a few basins and benches down with them.\nOnce, Gaming went with his father to purchase a batch of new tea from the farmers, when a bamboo basket was passed to him, he performed a \"Suanni's Salutation\" on reflex, raising the basket and beginning to dance. The tea leaves were scattered everywhere, and Gaming wound up being chased around the village with his father in hot pursuit. And when the father finally returned, pulling his son by the ear, their meal had already gone cold, and the mistress of the house had long been waiting expectantly at the door for their return, rattan rod in hand...\nIn spring, autumn, winter, and summer, his parents would sit at home, his father nursing some tea and his mother snacking on melon seeds, and watch their son jump up and down, beast-head in hand...\nIt is a pity that such days, so ordinary they could not be more ordinary, can now only return in dreams."

        "Title": "Character Story 5",
        "Context": "Children really do change as they grow up, and that little child engrossed in watching Wushou Dance grew to become a spirited youth. The one thing that did not change was his passion for Wushou Dance, and still he dreamed of making it big in Liyue Harbor one day. But compared to Yilong Wharf, things were different there. In Liyue Harbor, Wushou Dance was seen as a new-ish folk practice that originated in Chenyu Vale — it was appreciated, sure, but it was no money-maker, and certainly not ingrained in people's hearts in the same way Liyue opera was.\nThe more Gaming's father watched his son bustle about tirelessly, the more he worried about the youth's future, and not a few times did he speak seriously with the boy about the difficulties of starting a business. And each time, Gaming would retort that staying in business was harder yet, and declined to succeed his father in the tea leaf business. In earlier years, when his mother was still around, any impasse between the two could be broken up around the dinner table, but after she passed from illness, it was as if the glue from this father-son relationship had come unstuck, and they grew distant.\nGaming's father blamed her falling ill on the immense amount of labor she had put into starting the business with him, and by extension, himself. If something were to happen to their only son, how could he ever face her? And thus, when Gaming was once again injured when practicing Wushou Dance, he could take no more, and gave all of his son's equipment away, leaving only the beast head his wife had made. To his shock, Gaming left without a word the very next day, taking said head with him.\nIn truth, his son's departure did not only leave him angry, but also stewing in a melange of emotions and wavering reflection. He had in fact been constantly asking those close to him at the Communications Office to help take care of his son over the years, but whenever Gaming came up in conversation, his words could be brutal and blunt — nor would he put aside his pride to proactively mend relations.\nLeong, an assistant to the business, would write to Gaming come every festival, discussing some awkward matters that were neither here nor there — and of course, even a witless twit could guess that he was doing so at the behest of Gaming's father. Even so, Gaming was not as headstrong and free-spirited as he often appeared, and he never exposed Leong, instead going along with the letters, even asking after matters at home, intentionally or otherwise...\nTo Gaming, reading Leong's letters was akin to defusing a bomb, and in truth, he sometimes hoped to receive nothing at all. Just as he once feared that the villagers might come and say \"Your father's on his way to give you a good whooping,\" he now feared that someone might say \"Your father was at home when he had a fall\"... Whether then or now, no news was good news.\nThus did father and son continue to be stubborn, each seemingly convinced that the other would understand them in time... Gladsome was it, then, that ever-ardent Ms. Xianyun would intercede before such reticence could turn to regret. With the bridge she built, and with the aid of able allies, Gaming's father was finally able to center himself and find calm, finishing watching his son's masterful, exciting Wushou Dance performance. From awkwardness to active dialog they went, and at last, they were again able to open up to each other, with Gaming's father accepting his son's career choice.\n\"Well, remember to come watch next time I perform in Liyue Harbor.\"\n\"I don't need you to tell me that.\"\n\"In that case, don't chat too long over dim sum, or you might not be able to squeeze your way in when you come late...\"\n\"You rascal!\""

        "Title": "To My Boy, Gaming",
        "Context": "Gaming doesn't like reading, but he has kept a book under his pillow for years. Tucked inside its pages is the only letter his mother ever wrote to him.\n\"...The thing I'm most worried about after I'm gone is that you and your father will get into arguments every day. All this agitation is simply no good for anyone. Don't blame your dad, he's more bark than bite. He's just concerned that you'll have a tough time on your own in the future and doesn't want you to go through such hardships. Do you remember that time when you sprained your leg? Your father was so anxious that he ran frantically to the physician, with you on his back. He was worried sick, and he secretly cried under the blankets that night. You are a big boy now, do show some consideration for your dad and let him have his way sometimes. Don't quarrel with your dad if you can help it...\"\n\"...Don't worry, I'm not against you learning Wushou Dance. In fact, I'm glad that you found something you like and enjoy doing while you were young. But you have to promise me to be careful and not force yourself so you don't get hurt! And please be careful not to eat anything too heaty, cold or raw, and don't be too picky about what you eat and drink... Remember to wear more layers when it's stormy and raining, don't neglect keeping yourself warm just because you want to look cool!\"\n\"...As you step into society, you have to stay true to yourself. Don't let yourself or others down. The worst thing you can do is to make empty promises and be someone who is 'all talk, no action.'\"\n\"There's no harm in knowing more people. If you find a friend who you can really connect with, you absolutely must treat them well with a sincere heart. It's not about the number of friends you have but the quality of your friendships. You should count yourself lucky if you find someone you can rely on. I know you won't want to talk to your dad about things that are bothering you, so just find a friend whom you can share your woes with. No matter what you do, don't bottle up your feelings, and definitely don't do anything silly, alright?\"\n\"I'm feeling a little tired, so I'll take a rest now. I know I always say, 'You little rascal, I wish I'd given birth to a chunk of char siu instead of you,' and you always sulk when you hear it... But I want you to know that you're not a little rascal and that you're so, so much better than a piece of char siu... You will always be my little boy that I cherish and love most in the world...\"\nJudging from the creases, the letter has been opened and put away again and again. Placing it between the pages of a book was indeed a clever way to preserve the letter.\nThe book in which he kept the letter had been used by his mother as a coaster for her teacup, and now that it had passed down to Gaming, he too had found a new purpose for it.\n\"Mom actually told me I should read more. Please, has she ever opened the book herself? Oh, oops, pretend I didn't say anything! Otherwise, Mom will give me a good whacking in my dreams!\"\nGaming never cries when he talks about his mother in front of others. He knows she would have wanted him to be optimistic and happy and move on with his life. And that's exactly what he did.\nIt's just that the wind always blows sand into his eyes when he's alone and when he's thinking about his mother, even when he's in his bedroom, where there's neither wind nor sand."

        "Title": "Vision",
        "Context": "A certain question had always vexed Gaming — what does a Suanni look like, exactly? Having asked his seniors, he found out that they had never seen a real one either, and they had relied on their teachers to hand down the art of Wushou Dance to them. If he really wanted to find out, it was going to be an adventure unto itself.\nRandom chance allowed him to borrow a few old texts about the solitary Suanni hidden in the mountains from Xingqiu. Several nights did he do battle against the unfamiliar words that rushed his position like a relentless army of ants, only to be defeated at last, remembering only a few key phrases like \"fierce,\" \"majestic,\" and \"untamed.\"\nA giant beast of most heroic bearing indeed! He was sure that if only he could lay eyes upon it, he would gain much inspiration for his Wushou Dance performances. It was with this belief that Gaming would often poke about the locations the books mentioned. And when he came to Mt. Lingmeng, he sensed an oppressive aura about, as if a pair of eyes hidden in the bushes were watching him. This was it, Gaming intuited.\nBefore dawn broke the next day, he made himself presentable, and brought his favorite beast head and a big bag of food offerings into the mountains. Suddenly, a strong gust blew by, and before he could react, a dark shadow had swooped about him, looping around him in circles. He immediately closed his eyes and clapped his hands together, stating his intent in a reverent and loud voice.\n\"O Great Suanni, Gaming greets you! I came here simply to witness your majesty... and I brought lots of good food for your enjoyment, too! Now, ah, if you don't mind, could I open my eyes?\"\nHearing no more movement, he slowly re-opened his eyes, only to witness a large... difference between how he had imagined a Suanni to look and this cute little creature that sat proudly upon a giant stone.\n\"Whoa, seriously!? You're so tiny! And cute! Who's a good Suanni? That's right, you are! C'mon, let me give you some headpats, and...\"\nIn his excitement, Gaming overstepped and displeased the Suanni, and though it was indeed very small, it had an extraordinary energy about it, and like a furious flame it jumped all around the young man until he grew dizzy, the items he had brought dropping from his hands. Almost unconsciously, Gaming grabbed at the beast head and began dueling the creature. What the Suanni would do, Gaming would imitate, and so they continued from daylight till dusk — to a bystander, they might even have seemed like playmates meeting again after a long separation. Finally, the Suanni seemed to acknowledge him, and as it shook its head about, a shiny stone popped out of its mane.\n\"Really? A Vision, too? Is this what they mean by 'good things come in pairs'?\"\nCarefully did Gaming approach that stone, finding it to be an absolutely real, positively genuine chunk of ore that had only shone under the glare of the setting sun.\nAh, a misunderstanding, then. It was a shame, of course, but it did not dampen his mood — indeed, it was from this moment that the \"Mighty Mythical Beasts\" troupe was formally founded.\nFrom that day onward, Gaming and Man Chai were inseparable, and he quickly forgot about that whole Vision affair...\nSome time later, Gaming was escorting a merchant caravan when he encountered a ruthless gang of bandits. The merchants advised him to retreat — lost cargo could be written off as a cost of business, but lost lives could not.\n\"Hah! I've never been able to stand those who steal and rob for a living. Even if I wasn't on the job, I'd give them a piece of my mind, and as it happens, making them regret their life choices is my job and I'm on the clock. You go first, boss, and I'll hold the line here. I guarantee not one crate will be lost, nor will a single hair on your heads be harmed!\"\nThus did Gaming go one against ten, and though he sustained numerous injuries, he persevered until all the brigands were bound, and both the Millelith and his colleagues had arrived, before allowing himself to slump over.\nThe merchants would later inspect their goods, only to find that, indeed, not a single item was missing, and there was even something that had not been in the manifest — a Vision.\nThey wrapped the item carefully before having it delivered, alongside the thank-you plaque they gave Gaming, to the Sword and Strongbox Agency.\nGaming was caught completely off-guard by the gem, with only surprise and not gladness registering in his heart, which was instead overwhelmed with a series of questions.\n\"What, really? Is this mine? I mean, I was just escorting some goods, nothing special. I mean, don't I do that every day?\"\n\"Should I return it? But to whom? The caravan? No, wait, they said it wasn't theirs... Could it have been... that no-good low-down crook's?\"\n\"No, no, what am I thinking! Well, in that case... I guess this Vision really maybe probably might be mine, then?\"\n\"But I've heard that they have to do with strong wishes. I didn't get it back when I was dancing in front of Man Chai, and now I just... randomly got it on the job. Does that mean... that I was always meant to be a guard, but I was led astray by Wushou Dance?\"\n\"Is this a hint that I should give up on it? In that case, I'd rather not have this Vision at all!\"\nThis lasted until he got the wrapping cloth off the plaque—\nAnd then he saw it, shaped as it was: like a beast of good omen, ears and eyes on the alert, seeing and hearing all.\nThe defeat of these crooks, he realized, was a deed that made him akin in spirit to the monster-subjugating Suanni.\nOnly then did the doubt clouding over Gaming's heart clear, and in response, he cleaned his hands on his clothes before accepting this Vision with all due ceremony."
