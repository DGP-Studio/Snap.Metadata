Known for her holistic approach, she utilizes a combination of the hot springs' warm and soothing waters, serene fragrances, and her own miraculous youkai powers to expel the deep-seated unease troubling her patients.\nWord gradually got out that this woman — or rather, yumekui-baku in a woman's form — was actually the Aisa Bathhouse's major shareholder; not only the core founding investor, but also the decision-maker behind its recent renovation.\nYet she was nothing like your typical behind-the-scenes investor, instead showing both the professionalism of a doctor and the forbearing dedication of an ordinary employee. Immersed in her frontline duties, she meticulously consulted with every patient, diagnosing, prescribing, then administering treatments with pinpoint precision and cool-headed composure.\nIn this way, Mizuki rapidly made quite a name for herself among those tormented by persistent nightmares.\nThe elderly, perhaps, might remember hearing bedtime stories about yumekui-baku in their childhood — and among them, funnily enough, the name of Yumemizuki Mizuki in particular would no doubt ring a bell.\nMizuki's peaceful and carefree demeanor, however, make it somewhat difficult for people to associate her with the youkai of those fading legends.\nBut the Aisa Bathhouse is only the first step in Mizuki's grand plan. Although progress has been slow, her vision is to eventually expand into a fully-fledged conglomerate, offering the people of Inazuma both comprehensive entertainment and improved mental well-being.\nTo this end, she continues to explore methods that go beyond simply relying upon her youkai powers — everything from mind-calming exercises to invigorating amusement parks, structured dietary plans, and even traditional games to bring joy and laughter to her patients once more.\nKnowing little about Mizuki, employees who catch a glimpse of her busy schedule can't help but feel worried for her. Might their boss, clearly far more overworked than any of them, be weighed down by hidden fatigue and anxiety too?"

        "Context": "Though it would be unfair to say that the yumekui-baku were entirely unheard of, yet compared to the likes of the kitsune — almost ubiquitous in lore and legend — or the gallant tengu, or the fearsome and awe-inspiring oni, they had never been of any particular renown.\nAt the great gathering known as the \"Hyakumonogatari Taikai,\" the baku were little more than bit-part characters. Some would sit there in a quiet corner sipping away at their tea, while others could be found alongside fellow lesser youkai, listening respectfully to the lofty rhetoric and grandiose tales of the great and mighty. Others still might act as attendants, pouring tea and sake for refined individuals like Urakusai.\nFor the young baku Yumemizuki Mizuki, the sole pleasure of attending those banquets back then lay in marveling at how her friend, the young kitsune Yae Miko, dazzled others with her sharp wit and ingenuity.\nWatching Miko debating tirelessly with Urakusai, curled up on the shoulder of the older Kitsune Saiguu, Mizuki always ended up munching through several times her usual share of snacks. Delighting in the way she dissected her opponent's arguments, Mizuki often nodded in admiration at her friend's quick thinking, even memorizing her brilliant retorts word-for-word.\nThe next morning, catching sight of a yawning Miko, Mizuki would eagerly approach her with a bowl of freshly-fried tofu, ready to resume their conversation from the night before.\nMizuki's near-fawning enthusiasm sometimes caught Miko quite off guard. On such occasions, she would elegantly cover her face with a flick of her fluffy tail, then quickly change the subject by saying, \"Let's go grab some ramen.\"\nWhether nose-to-bowl in front of Master Karasu's ramen stall, perched up high atop the sturdiest sakura branch on the southern slopes of Mt. Yougou, or lounging on beaches bathed in the setting sun's glow, the young kitsune and the little baku were inseparable, chatting away about everything and anything.\nEven the untold secrets of their deepest dreams became treasures that they shared with one another.\nBut as the successor to Hakushin Kitsune's bloodline, the duties that awaited Miko, and the responsibilities that growing up entailed for her, were a heavy load to bear indeed.\nWhen Miko, then Mizuki in turn, acquired the power to take humanoid form, the two of them were swept apart by the currents of life — just like humans — each carried off to different waters of the world.\nUnder Kitsune Saiguu's tutelage, Miko went on to fathom profound mysteries of youkai magic, and, surrounded by the maidens of the Grand Narukami Shrine, mastered the 880 precepts of the Guuji. As the Hakushin bloodline's rising star, Miko moved through the ranks of the big, the bad, the great, and the good, solidifying her kin's standing in the world of the youkai.\nHer world was like the vast sea they once gazed at together — tumultuous and ever-changing, filled with all sorts of dangers and challenges, but brimming with endless possibilities too.\nMizuki, meanwhile, slipped into an altogether quieter life. Much of her time she spent farming or weaving with her fellow baku to make ends meet, but she would also set off on patrol at fixed times, devouring nightmares for those who sought her help.\nIt was like she'd drifted downstream into a perfectly still lake, placid to the point of monotony.\nTheir outings together grew less and less frequent, until eventually, even their agreement to spend time together once a month became too difficult to keep.\nMizuki, however, felt no regret as a result of this.\nAfter all, she still left home at exactly the same time as Miko each morning; and when Miko took the bowl of fried tofu that Mizuki had prepared for her, she still gave her that same old smile — reserved only for her closest friends.\nMizuki doubted she could bear even a tenth of Miko's responsibilities, and whenever they walked together, she felt crushed by the weight of the gazes that bore down upon them from all sides.\nShe was quite content to play a bit part without many lines, simply providing Miko with a sense of peace when she needed it."

Humans and youkai alike were rendered helpless beneath the weight of its evil, and the islands resounded with cries of despair.\nIll-suited for battle, the baku had no choice but to beat a hasty retreat, seeking safety in nooks and crannies of the land so unfrequented that they escaped the calamity's notice.\nAfter the last vestiges of evil had finally been vanquished by the Shogun, Mizuki and her kin returned with great trepidation, only to find that their once-thriving settlement had been reduced to ruins.\nFrantic with worry, Mizuki searched far and wide for her friends, seeing only heartbreaking scenes of loss and separation everywhere she went.\nGone without a trace was the familiar figure of Kitsune Saiguu. Instead, Mizuki found Miko — eyes dim, face pale, cheeks streaked with faint trails of tears — bowed in prayer before the withered Sacred Sakura.\nThus was the Miko she knew so well prematurely forced to shoulder the responsibilities that awaited her, becoming the revered Guuji Yae.\nFrom then on, even their morning encounters became a thing of the past. Snowed under by the avalanche of recovery work, Miko had no choice but to move into the Grand Narukami Shrine, where she worked tirelessly day and night.\nSoon, the yumekui-baku too found themselves swamped with relentless requests; for the shattered land of Inazuma was now strewn with the traumatized, scarred in both body and mind, humans and youkai alike.\nThe calamity may have been driven back for the time being, but all were haunted by the remembrance of its horrors, and these fears took root in the very depths of their dreams. Night after night, these victims were beset by waves of endless terrors, eating away at their willpower and eroding their resolve.\nThe residual dread was so overwhelming that even the baku elder herself proved unable to withstand it. One day, she collapsed after dispelling the nightmares of several Shogunate samurai, falling into a coma for many months. When she finally awoke, she was too frail to continue performing her duties, and so was forced to retire.\nIt was at this moment that the hitherto unremarkable Yumemizuki Mizuki revealed her talents unlooked-for. When she extracted the dark poison from the victims' minds, the pain she felt was excruciating — not unlike the sensation of being cut or burned. Yet clearly, this was far better than drifting off into a deep sleep that could last for months on end.\nAnd so Mizuki became a beacon of hope for the victims, helping them free themselves from the nightmares by which they were tormented. Laden with an unbearable weight of anguish, she would stagger back each day, retreating to a secluded spot to recover in quiet solitude.\nThat may have been Mizuki's most trying time, as she shared every second of the victims' pain. Day and night, her vision was filled with a deep, purplish-blackness that seemed to flow and spread like blood oozing from an open wound.\nFortunately, she could draw strength from the image of her dearest friend, carved deeply into her subconscious mind. Whenever Mizuki teetered on the brink of collapse, that cherry-blossom pink always brought her back to her senses.\n\"As Guuji, it's Miko job to help the Shogun deal with the problems of the physical world... I, too, must do my duty, and that's to help others overcome their spiritual pain!\"\nBy reassuring herself so, Mizuki always found the strength to continue.\nYet, single-mindedly immersed in her work as she was, there was one thing she overlooked — that, in the blink of an eye, a century had flown by.\nWhile Mizuki had been tending to her countless patients and calming the turbulence of their traumas, the Miko she once knew had steadily been shaped by the weight of her duties. More frequently, the Guuji now wore the smile of one who mocked the fleeting transience of the mortal world.\nOn the rare occasion that they found themselves sitting together by their old ramen stand, they repeatedly struggled to connect — the air thick with an alien silence, despite the fact that they had once been so close that they could share anything.\nAfter much contemplation, Mizuki decided to give her friend the benefit of the doubt and came to terms with the way things had turned out.\nThe pain that Miko suffered during the calamity, she told herself, must have far exceeded her own. Ordinary youkai could not even begin to imagine the burdens entailed by being Guuji of the Grand Narukami Shrine.\nWithout adopting such pointed composure, she reasoned, Miko may have been unable to endure the relentless onslaught of challenges that had come her way.\nHaving experienced such different environments, it was only natural that their reflections would diverge.\nAt the very least, they had both done their utmost to fulfill their respective duties. The way things were now was but the outcome of having made the best possible decisions that they could have.\nTo rely on a familiar figure as a source of comfort, hoping she would remain forever frozen as she was in memory... Inevitably, that would only serve as a shackle for them both.\nWhether they liked it or not, their carefree days were gone for good. They each had their own paths to follow, so why not do so freely without clinging to the past?\nLet the memories of those bygone days stay where they belonged — safe and sound, in the depths of her inner self."

        "Context": "Not all nightmares are the same. For individuals who are otherwise sound in mind and body, occasional nightmares caused by passing clouds of gloom are a natural source of nourishment for the yumekui-baku. But the nocturnal terrors of those afflicted by chronic illness or severe trauma are altogether a different animal. The baku may still consume them, even likening the experience to eating flavorless bread, yet their toxic threat remains undiminished.\nEven Mizuki, the most gifted of her kind, would find herself plagued by persistent ailments if she devoured too many of the latter.\nTo prevent healers from succumbing to the very maladies they sought to cure, Mizuki began exploring methods beyond her natural youkai powers, seeking to detoxify such negative emotions prior to consumption.\nAnd so, once she was certain that the dark calamity's lingering shadows had been fully suppressed, Mizuki set off for foreign lands. Her aim was to study humanity's most cutting-edge medical practices in order to develop her very own system of \"clinical psychological therapy.\"\nIn Mondstadt, working with the Adventurers' Guild, she took on a part-time role as a \"post-trauma disorder treatment consultant,\" gaining invaluable experience in hands-on clinical care.\nIn Liyue, under the guidance of the physicians of Chenyu Vale, she familiarized herself with various medicinal herbs that could be used to calm the mind and spirit, as well as the intricate process of cultivating and using them.\nIn Sumeru, inspired by the local incense burners, she built upon her previous explorations of herbal medicines by devising a method of aromatic therapy, using incense as a healing aid to facilitate relaxation and sleep.\nAnd in Fontaine, she supplemented her knowledge by delving into the theoretical medical insights of the Research Institute. By considering the scientific underpinnings of avant-garde cinematography, she even discovered fascinating connections between visual patterns and human psychology.\nAfter years of study and exploration, Mizuki eventually reached her final destination — the vibrant land of the seemingly indefatigable People of the Springs in Natlan's southern regions.\nNot only did the \"hot spring warriors\" give Mizuki the warmest of welcomes, they also showed her their courage by valiantly facing down enemies who shared the same origins as the dark calamity that had once blighted her native land.\nOf all the people she met, Mualani in particular left a lasting impression. The first time they crossed paths, Mualani had been dashing about, playing tag with a group of children, when all of a sudden she had lost her footing — at which point, she accidentally crashed straight into Mizuki, then dragged her down together into the hot spring beside them. A somewhat clumsy first impression, by any account...\nYet in the face of fearsome foes, Mualani's boundless optimism became an unshakable pillar of strength. Not only was she utterly dependable, but even after a fight, she showed no signs of the usual psychological scars that Mizuki had grown so accustomed to seeing.\nSpurred on by her curiosity, Mizuki investigated further, finally concluding that — aside from sheer willpower — a balanced lifestyle was crucial to mental well-being.\nLiving their lives to the fullest in peacetime, brimming with energy and savoring every moment, and then stepping onto the battlefield without regrets, refreshed and ready for the fight — could this, Mizuki wondered, be the secret to the strength of Natlan's warriors?\n\"Play hard, fight hard, huh... Treating life's conundrums as you would challenges in a game — taking them on in a composed, timely manner.\"\nAnd thus, Mizuki conceived the idea of establishing an \"entertainment group.\" Her vision was to introduce the residents of Inazuma to a wide range of different leisure activities, and thereby significantly improve their mental well-being.\nFrom the People of the Springs, she got the idea of hot springs and water sports; from the Scions of the Canopy, of (relatively) safe extreme sports like rock climbing and mountaineering; and she even planned to set up fitness centers staffed by professional trainers from the Collective of Plenty. With a team of collaborators soon in place, Mizuki's vision began to take shape..."

        "Context": "In Inazuman folklore, the yumekui-baku have always been celebrated for their benevolent and carefree nature, depicted as beings without wants of their own, yet ever ready to help others in need.\nMizuki is a shining example of this in the flesh. Despite her extensive experience in helping others ward off nightmares, she has never capitalized on her reputation by increasing her fees, instead maintaining a remarkably lenient pricing policy.\nWhen treating the common folk, she calculates her labor fee by adhering to a strict formula — half of the patient's hourly wage multiplied by the duration of the session. Even when it amounts to no more than the price of a bowl of ramen, she accepts her meager earnings without a word of discontent.\nIn Mizuki's eyes, these patients suffer enough as-is, so the least she can do is avoid adding financial burdens to their woes.\nFor wealthier patients, she asks them to set their own price, saying, \"Given your means, what would you consider fair payment for this treatment?\"\nWhether out of respect for Mizuki or simply to uphold their own sense of pride, such patients invariably end up proposing handsome prices indeed...\nThis approach has earned her services widespread acclaim, leading to a steady stream of appointments that keeps her so busy that she often goes for weeks without a single day off.\nAfter consuming a patient's nightmares, it always feels as if she has eaten a large bowl of rice. So long as the toxins are not too potent, both her youkai power and physical strength will be replenished.\nBy all accounts, Mizuki seldom indulges in personal spending. Aside from a few simple outfits and the occasional inexpensive dessert, she rarely treats herself to anything, keeping her living expenses to a bare minimum.\nA youkai with practically no time off, almost no inclination to spend, nearly zero expenditure, and a relentless work ethic... Given several centuries, just how much could such an individual save up? Without any precedents to compare her against, it's a tough question to answer.\nNo matter how you arrive at your estimate, one thing is for certain — that her savings must be substantial, to say the very least. And they were, in fact, the foundation that underpinned Mizuki's own investments.\nFor a time, the turmoil caused by the Sakoku Decree prevented her from returning to Inazuma, leaving her unable to inspect the progress that had been made on the Aisa Bathhouse. Several of her other ventures, too, remained stuck at the planning stage, with no hope of headway in sight...\nYet during this period, Mizuki was far from idle. She worked tirelessly to keep abreast of all the latest trends in Teyvat, ensuring that her future businesses could cater to all age groups and alleviate the troubles of patients young and old.\nInspired by modern theories, she strove to make the process less daunting for her patients by stripping it of its overtly \"clinical\" characteristics. She referred to her patients as \"guests\" and rebranded the serious business of therapy as a form of leisure, meticulously refining every detail to foster an atmosphere of complete relaxation.\nUpon returning to Inazuma, Mizuki applied the research findings she had acquired in Fontaine, personally starring in a series of innovative new \"promotional programs\" designed to catapult her reputation to new heights.\nDespite having plenty of awkward moments in front of the Kamera, and how she sometimes got so nervous that she could hardly catch her breath, she knew that if she could just convince people to try out her new approach to therapy — so they could put their worries behind them, once and for all — then it would all be worth it.\nBut aside from her own publicity efforts, Mizuki just so happened to also know a fellow professional with great potential for collaboration.\nAnd that was none other than her old friend, Yae Miko — editor-in-chief of the cultural and artistic hub that was the Yae Publishing House."

        "Context": "\"When helping patients cope with their anxiety, should the emphasis be on gradually guiding them to come face to face with the source of their mental struggles, or on offering reassurance, prioritizing the alleviation of their unease?\"\n\"When dispelling nightmares, is there any risk that the direct removal of negative emotions through prolonged reliance on youkai powers might lead to unintended side effects?\"\n\"If we can't help patients resolve their real-world problems, how can we ensure that they don't relapse?\"\n...\nFinally back from her century-long odyssey, Mizuki had so much to discuss with her old friend Miko.\nBeneath the sakura tree where they used to meet as children, they spread out a tablecloth, laid out some snacks, and held a little tea party, chatting from dawn until dusk.\nTheir elation at being reunited was accompanied by a rational exchange of ideas, giving them both a chance to share their heartfelt thoughts.\nMiko was of the opinion that entertainment must stay pure and simple, just as it was in essence. If patients could actively seek out happiness and fill their minds with vibrant, positive thoughts, they might very well be able to eliminate any possible foothold for negative emotions to take root.\nMizuki, however, was concerned that focusing solely on the \"pursuit of happiness\" without addressing the core of a patient's struggles could lead to an emotional imbalance.\nAs the tea party came to an amicable close, they both accepted the other's perspective, understanding that, in their own unique way, they would each come up with novel solutions to help the people of Inazuma overcome their inner demons.\nAs Mizuki saw it, the Yae Publishing House's approach — focused mainly on light novels while branching off into various other forms of cultural entertainment — immersed customers in a myriad of fantastical worlds, injecting hope and vitality back into their lives.\nThe issue, however, was that cultural products required a certain level of engagement. People who were too physically, mentally, or emotionally drained might struggle to muster the energy or concentration required for extended reading and contemplation.\nOn top of this, if a person was to completely lose themselves in the fantasy world of light novels, they might inadvertently begin to overlook pressing real-world issues.\nThe entertainment group that Mizuki had envisioned would not only address the challenges faced by the yumekui-baku, but also fill in this missing piece of the puzzle—\nFirstly, healing those who had neither the time nor the energy to enjoy more demanding forms of cultural entertainment and helping them find new joys in life.\nAnd secondly, helping those who had become lost in escapism by gently guiding their focus back to their inner selves.\nIn this way, people from all walks of life in Inazuma — from hardworking common folk to learned literati — could be aided in finding a holistic solution for improving their spiritual well-being, regardless of their wealth or status.\nIn cases where the patient's mental and emotional struggles were so deep-seated that they could not be alleviated through conventional methods, or with particularly delicate issues that required careful handling, Mizuki would fall back upon her baku powers to cleanse the toxic shadows from their dreams.\nMethodical, systematic, and seamless to a tee.\nThat said, as ever, neighborhood gossip tended to focus on superficial details. Based on rumors from who knows where, word quickly went out that the major shareholder of Aisa Bathhouse, \"y'know, the one who just returned from abroad,\" was seeking to challenge the Yae Publishing House itself with a brand new business venture.\nThe rumors grew increasingly sensational, even inspiring works like \"A Business Battle Between Childhood Friends\" which quickly became the talk of the town.\nWhen this tale reached Mizuki's ears, she was quite taken aback for a moment, but a smile quickly followed.\nWell, that... didn't sound like such a bad idea.\nMiko had always relished this type of fun, and it was indeed true that Mizuki felt determined to push forward in her career, eager to surpass the friend who had once strode ahead of her.\nWith mutual understanding, the two friends became tacitly-acknowledged \"business rivals.\""

        "Context": "Wherever Mizuki goes, her two little baku companions are never far behind. Indeed, they are practically inseparable.\nIn her day-to-day life, the two little baku act like her assistants, helping Mizuki make drinks, cook meals, and fetch things that she requires.\nWhen she's busy fighting off monsters and knaves, not only will they cheer her on, they'll even jump in to join the fray...\nMizuki calls them \"Ya-chan\" and \"Te-chan,\" simple yet meaningful names that carry connotations of \"emotional stability\" and \"rational thinking.\"\nThey are not, however, Mizuki's kin, but rather manifestations of her youkai powers and embodiments of her spirit and wisdom.\nClinical psychologists absorb their patients' sorrows, anxieties, and fears, yet their own negative emotions often go unaddressed. Over time, their beleaguered hearts put them at risk of a total and irrevocable breakdown.\nMizuki has seen colleagues fall apart completely. Seeing them lying there immobile — some not only bedridden, but even mentally incapacitated — she quietly warned herself never to follow that same path.\nFor this reason, Mizuki also conducts therapy on herself.\nPicture a version of her, overflowing with emotion, who could empathize with patients as naturally as drawing breath, yet whose own mood was as fragile as gossamer, collapsing at the slightest touch...\nThen imagine another version of her who, guided purely by reason, applied logic to every problem, stripping away all subjective emotions to the point of seeming somewhat cold and detached...\nThe two little baku, embodying these two different aspects of Mizuki's self, each have their own flaws. As they accompany her when she is treating patients, they offer analyses from the most extreme of perspectives, not even stinting to outline the full consequences that such extremes would entail.\nAfterwards, Mizuki comforts the two of them as if gazing into mirrors of opposing natures, giving her a chance to pick apart the easily overlooked yet potentially devastating issues lying dormant within her own heart.\nWhen contemplating certain issues, if she starts to feel too fragile, she adopts the mindset of someone with a broader perspective by summoning up a degree of cold detachment...\nWhen communicating with someone, if she finds their mood worsening as a result of her coming across too harshly, she can also take a step back and start again from an empathetic perspective — and by doing this, she can strike a balance between objective logic and subjective emotions.\nThis process of communicating with Ya-chan and Te-chan also plays a pivotal role in how Mizuki balances her own emotions.\nAfter having been through centuries of refinement and observing countless patient interactions, Ya-chan and Te-chan's perspectives no longer dwell at the opposite poles of emotion and reason. Much like Mizuki herself, they can now find a middle ground between the two — most of the time, at least.\nThe day that Ya-chan's excessive empathy no longer easily ends in tears, and Te-chan learns not to dish out sharp critiques of overly subjective patients, will be the day that Mizuki has become nigh-impervious to even the most powerful of negative emotions."

        "Context": "Even the most delicious of dishes, if eaten three times a day, every day, for hundreds or even thousands of meals in a row, would become unbearable for your average person.\nYet in Mizuki's world of dream-cuisine, bland nightmares are a blessing to be savored.\nSome people's nightmares are like the apocalyptic aftermath of a kitchen explosion — a chaotic mix of seasonings with acrid undertones of charred woodsmoke, a slight tang of rust, and harsh, acidic notes to round it all off.\nBut what about good dreams?\nVery few yumekui-baku even know what they taste like, for their kind follow an unwritten rule: \"Never eat someone else's good dreams without permission.\"\nIt wasn't until her tenth year as a clinical psychologist that Mizuki finally had the rare privilege of tasting such a precious delicacy.\nOne day, a girl who had made a full recovery thanks to Mizuki's therapy came to express her gratitude with a gift. As they chatted, the girl suddenly suggested the idea of sharing one of her colorful, vibrant dreams.\nIt was a dreamscape brimming with innocence, energy, and dazzling fantasy. Mizuki was utterly captivated by its flavor... Pleasant, warm, and delicately sweet.\nFrom that day on, Mizuki developed a love for all kinds of desserts, and soon, a bold idea began to take root in her heart.\nCould the indescribable beauty of a good dream be a remedy in itself, powerful enough to dissolve negative emotions all on its own?\nIf she could create such dreams with her youkai powers, they might serve as a potent medicine for her patients' emotional struggles.\nAnd maybe, just maybe... they could also be treasured as exquisite delicacies, a treat for herself, every now and then?\nSadly, however, the baku do not possess the power of creation. Good dreams are, in a sense, the pure and untainted projections of a person's desires. As such, they cannot easily be replicated by outside forces, let alone conjured out of thin air...\nSince everyone's desires differ, there can be no universal \"recipe\" for creating a one-size-fits-all sweet dream. Attempting to probe a person's innermost thoughts — to fathom their deepest secrets — might itself become an act of intrusion, only adding to their anxiety and unease.\nRegrettably, therefore, Mizuki was unable to figure out the secret to creating a cure-all dream.\nBut fortunately, the decades of searching and studying were not in vain. Her dedication was eventually rewarded...\nOne weary yet fulfilling night, Mizuki dreamt of becoming a little baku once more, and of sharing a meal with her dearest friend by a ramen stall.\nThis particular dream had a delicate, smoky feel to it, almost like a gentle breeze, and it seemed to share the same outline that many happy dreams had in common.\nUnbound, unburdened, and carefree...\nAs the dream unfolded, a radiant, crystalline Vision silently appeared by Mizuki's pillow.\nFrom then on, Mizuki took a new approach, as if she had been inspired.\nShe resolved to guide people towards tranquil, soothing dreams, rekindling memories of the things they treasured most.\nShe believed that all the good and beauty that people cherished deep inside them would surely awaken at crucial moments, coloring their dreams and transforming them into the most magnificent forms imaginable."
