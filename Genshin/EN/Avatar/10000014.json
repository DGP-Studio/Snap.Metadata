After quickly realizing that she barely knew any of the words, she had to resort to humming the tune instead.\nNevertheless, her voice began to soothe the child, and so she kept singing. She sang the same song, over and over again, until her throat was dry and her voice was hoarse. Finally, the boy fell asleep. Exhausted, Barbara lay down by the wall and fell straight asleep herself.\nEarly the next morning, Barbara awoke to discover that the boy's fever had come down. Perhaps it was because she had sung for him, or perhaps it had something to do with the Vision which had mysteriously appeared next to her hand at some point during the night.\nBarbara was not preoccupied with the Vision, however. It was the sight of the boy smiling once again that filled her heart with joy.\nBarbara received her Vision for the simple but beautiful wish that took hold in her heart that night: A dream of healing the sick through the power of song."
