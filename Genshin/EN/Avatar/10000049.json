As such, please add Her Excellency's emblem — the Electro Mitsudomoe — into the fireworks repertoire, if you would.\"\n\"Haha, just wait for it!\" Yoimiya replied, agreeing with great confidence.\nBefore the show could begin, Yoimiya ran all about the city, placing thousands of launch tubes in every nook and cranny. At the festival's finale, the blazing fireworks formed a gigantic picture scroll that depicted the city of Inazuma in the skies.\nYet Ayaka did not find the critical emblem in any one of these fireworks, and wondered if Yoimiya had made an error in her arrangements.\nIt was only after speaking with Yoimiya that Ayaka discovered that the image of Inazuma in the skies had an \"angling\" trick added to it.\nIf viewed from the Tenshukaku, the fireworks would form a huge, clear, and orderly image of the Raiden Shogun's house-crest — with some playfully lacy decorations on the side to boot.\nOf course, how could Yoimiya miss a beat at a fireworks performance? This way, she won the praise of both the people and the Raiden Shogun, and this feast would become a timeless classic deeply rooted in the memories of countless people.\nWith Yoimiya around, the Inazuman summer shall not lack any glorious fireworks — thus was her nickname, \"Queen of the Summer Festival,\" coined."

As such, people often feel that coming up to the door without important matters might hinder the work.\nHowever, it's just the opposite with Yoimiya, for chatting is her other great hobby. In fact, if there's no one to talk to, she might actually find it hard to focus.\nIf chatting with the guest is her way of \"understanding their mood and way of thinking, such that the best fireworks can be crafted,\" then going with the flow and sitting down for tea and an idle chat with them after delivering the goods is how Yoimiya rewards herself. Sometimes, if that is not enough, she will make some small-talk with her neighbors on the way, give them some small trinkets, and receive a basket of small treats in return...\nYoimiya is always able to strike a balance between listening and speaking in such chats.\nShe doesn't repeat herself, doesn't cross boundaries, doesn't come off as indifferent or overly invested. After a talk over tea, everyone leaves in a good mood.\nHer neighbors are all ordinary folk, and their lives are not exactly full of extraordinary things. Sometimes, the same news will be told by different people over and over, but Yoimiya does not find this upsetting.\nWhat she enjoys is the process of talking to others — even if they speak of the same matter, different people will have different viewpoints.\nAfter taking over the fireworks shop, Yoimiya's relationships with her neighbors became still more harmonious. Many old folks have taken her for an old acquaintance, and often invite her to their place to sit and recount the festivals of yesteryear. Middle-aged parents will ask Yoimiya to mediate the relationship between themselves and their children and will regale her with the little trivialities of daily family life. The young people treat Yoimiya as a sibling of sorts, volunteering to help her cart heavy fireworks-making materials around, hoping that Yoimiya will get off work faster and take the children out to play.\nYoimiya puts it this way: \"I believe in the unique power of language. There's nothing that can't be talked through somehow!\""

Looking out at the hazy amber-gold clouds, Yoimiya often gains new inspiration, imagining all manners of new fireworks in her mind, even as sleep draws near...\nHer neighbors have often found her sleeping in places like eaves, tree branches, and stopped waterwheels. Sometimes, she even falls down, before blearily watching her sweet dreams and golden stars fade away into the distance.\nFortunately, she has never been seriously injured in such incidents, but she has gotten a number of scrapes and cuts, and it was on that account that she learned how to deal with wounds.\nAt some other times, Yoimiya will sleep until midnight, settling all matters with gusto before heading out for a stroll.\nPerhaps it may turn out to be an impromptu adventure, or perhaps a test of courage. If a friend is interested, she might call upon them. If she wishes to be alone, she will travel in solitude.\nLiving as she pleases gives Yoimiya a sense of freedom. As for others, they may encounter her at any time at all. She enjoys this freedom, often saying that it has made her life very interesting indeed.\nOf course, she will restrain herself on the eve of celebrations.

This can be said to be Yoimiya's second career.\nAll manner of trinkets adorn the shelves, with some of them being exotic imports from Beidou that were modified and made into highly distinctive handicrafts, and others being practice works created during bursts of Yoimiya's explosive inspiration.\nFrom the Scatterbloom Marbles that will blossom when they knock against each other, Leaping Tops that chirp like birds as they spin, the Neon Dragonfly that changes hue as it ascends into the air, and the somewhat-failed Onikabuto Chariot... All these toys are inspired by the little games that the common people play.\nThey are not only popular among the children, but are much-loved by adults as well. Even Arataki Itto, the head of the Arataki Gang, comes over to buy her specially-made knickknacks, which he then brings to go challenge the one he has declared his nemesis.\nYoimiya's knickknacks are not just toys.

When ignited and hung up in the summer, it can be used to repel mosquitoes.\nMany people have come to ask Yoimiya for help on account of her excellent craftsmanship. And though she protests, saying, \"Hey now, this is a fireworks shop, not an everything shop. Even I can't possibly do it all,\" she will still try her best to help, even if her earnings for the whole day are only enough to buy a few snacks. She'll enjoy the whole thing, too — everyone in Hanamizaka is her friend, after all."

        "Context": "\"The rainbows become fireworks, and they my wishes know, my wishes rise into the skies, and through the night they show.\"\nThis nameless folksong has been around for a long time now. In recent years, it was misconstrued by the children to mean that as long as they brought some shiny trinkets, they could exchange them with Yoimiya for fireworks that belong just to them, and that if they lit those fireworks up, their wish will come true at some point in the future.\nAs such, the children of Hanamizaka set about searching for beautiful little trinkets with this song on their lips, before bringing them to Yoimiya, with expectation eagarly written on their faces.\nYoimiya was quite troubled by this at first, but after hearing how the children had interpreted that song, she accepted their requests gladly and even added her own spin to the tale: the \"rainbows\" in the song not only refer to shiny treasures persay. As long as she found them \"sufficiently shiny,\" whether they were colored rocks from the creeks or shell fragments from the beaches, she would take them and make lovely fireworks as per the agreement.\nIndeed, if they were to bring her expensive things, she might, in turn, say that they are too ordinary, and take the child to look for the owner of those lost goods.\nBut it really did not matter if the treasures were shiny or not. The important part was the conviction the children had that \"rainbows\" could indeed be exchanged for \"fireworks.\"\nThough some might take it for naivete, Yoimiya will give her all to protect the lovely wishes that only children can have.\n\"The things we believed in and experienced as children become irreplaceable treasures.\"\nThe legendary picture books of Inazuma are often filled with the following images: the cute and playful Great Mujina Youkai, the majestic Shiba Warrior, the Origami Nue who appears out of nowhere...\nPerhaps those who drew demons in such cute forms also had a similar intention to Yoimiya.\nThe children gather around Yoimiya, enjoying a gladsome time even amidst Inazuma's lockdown.\nYoimiya's own child-like heart and liveliness never dulls, like fireworks and stars that shimmer and shine in the night sky."

        "Context": "Every festival, Yoimiya not only tries snacks from every store, but she also collects all sorts of candies, wrapping them up with care before storing them away inside a small candy box.\nYoimiya's candy box is a small crimson ball that has been decorated with delicate lanyards and ornate accessories, much like the hair accessories she often wears.\nEach time she encounters a joyous event, she will take one candy out of the box and eat it. If her friends or the children are around, she will share the sweets with them.\nYoimiya's neighbors often mistake her hair ornaments for the candy box, hence its erroneous nickname \"Sweet Pearl.\"\nThe speed at which the box lightens is taken as an important measure of happiness.\nThe quicker it empties, the more pleased Yoimiya is.\nSometimes, when things get busy, she sometimes absently uses the candy box as a hair accessory, realizing her mistake only after the day is done.\nStill, even this error would inspire Yoimiya. From then on, she would wear them interchangeably.\n\"Take a guess: does my hair ornament have candy in it today? Free pick of the sweets to anyone who gets it right!\""

        "Context": "Yoimiya is always up for a chat. It is only when the fireworks are ascending into the skies that she quiets down and just watches the lovely scenery.\nPeople often say that fireworks come and go in a fleeting heartbeat, but if they are memorable enough, they will remain in bloom forever in people's hearts.\nThose who accompanied you and the loveliness of the moment itself, will burrow deep into your mind as a beautiful memory.\nAnd as you look upon the same fireworks, many years later, that same memory and the feelings that came with it will surely rise again to the forefront of your heart.\nIs this not also \"Eternity\"?\nThe special firework formula slips that belong solely to the Naganohara family exist for precisely this purpose.\nBy incorporating goodwill and wishes into the gorgeous fireworks, ephemeral things are etched into eternity. This is the meaning of Yoimiya's line of work.\nOn one summer night following her taking over Naganohara Fireworks, Yoimiya could not sleep, and thus she continued in her research till daylight came.\nSuddenly, she heard a tinkling sound, and a burning-red object fell into an unused launching tube.\nAt first, Yoimiya used her Vision as a sort of lighter. Fortunately, her father discovered it and explained a Vision's significance to her.\nSo, this tiny gem could grant a person astonishing and mysterious powers. And yet what else could it do other than protect the children or chase some mischievous monsters away?\n\"Even if it could have other uses,\" Yoimiya thought, \"it may not ever need to do these things in my hands. I'm just someone who pursues happiness, a fireworks-maker who enjoys living life.\"\nTime has flown since then, and Yoimiya has grown ever more skilled in the manipulation of \"fire,\" with her skill at making fireworks having likewise increased.\nSometimes, she stops to ask herself this: \"How did someone as ordinary as me receive the acknowledgment of the gods? Do the gods... enjoy fireworks, by any chance?\""
