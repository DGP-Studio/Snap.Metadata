He is often seen in the company of his wolf pack, while generally avoiding contact with humans.\nSome speculate that he was an orphan raised by the wolves, while others say he is a wolf spirit that has taken on a human form.\nSuch rumors only add to the mystery of the \"Wolf Boy,\" as the denizens of Mondstadt call him.\nMeanwhile, Razor the Wolf Boy stands all the while on the hilltops with his head held high, basking in the warm sunlight."

The one thing he can't bring to mind is the faces of his parents.\nWhat kind of people were they? No matter how hard he tries, he cannot remember.\nHis memory starts after his life with the wolves had already begun. The wolves took him in as part of their \"Lupical\" — a word he was taught by someone else, which means family."

Cool off in the lake when you're hot, and go find some juicy berries when you're thirsty.\nRazor looks at his body and then at the bodies of his kin.\nHe knows he is different from them.\nBut there's nothing wrong with that, as far as Razor is concerned."

Why don't you come back down to Mondstadt with me?\"\nThe man offered his hand to Razor as he spoke.\nBut neither Razor nor the wolves understood the gesture. Feeling protective, the wolves placed themselves between Razor and the man to keep him away.\nRazor ducked down beneath the wolves' furry tails. He looked at his body, and then peered out through the gaps in the wolf fur to get a look at the man's.\nRazor knew he wasn't the most intelligent of beings, and was at a loss to answer the question that has been in his mind ever since that day.\n\"Am I a human, or a wolf?\""

Unwieldy though this steel claw may be, thought Razor, it was at least sharp enough to cut through tree branches.\n\"Now you can protect your friends.\"\n\"Fr-ren-dzz...\"\nRazor imitated the sounds the man made, without understanding what they meant.\nSimilarly, he did not understand why the names of things were all that important in the first place.

He just couldn't figure it out.\nUntil one day, Razor met a bright-red, 'burny' girl.\nThey stood in the wind together, got soaked in the rain together — she even rolled around in Wolfhook bushes with him.\nHer name was Klee. When Razor played with her, it was like being a wolf pup again.\n\"Friends... is... Lupical.\"\nRazor may not understand the complexity of human relationships, but he has an honest, primal loyalty to him.\n\"So... protect friends... Lupical... with life.\"\nThe wolf pack howls in the distance, summoning him home.\nRazor still does not know if he is a human or a wolf.\nBut he is happy either way."

He was ready to avenge.\nHe threw off his shackles and raised his weapon.\nThe Abyss Mage was overwhelmed and defeated by a wild, unfettered frenzy of Electro energy, but this time it was too late to save Razor's wolven companions.\n...\nThough he had obtained a Vision, Razor was still unable to manipulate Electro energy with finesse. One day many moons later, when he met the Witch of Purple Rose, Lisa, he began to study human knowledge.\n\"Friends, hurt... Never again! I will... protect them.\"\nWith each day, Razor grew more skilled in the use of his Vision. He made a silent promise to himself: \"I will become stronger. I will become the strongest of them all.\"\nBecause the day may come when his Lupical faces another threat, and this time, he will protect them."
