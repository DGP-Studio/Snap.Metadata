I always had a lot of fun at such festivals, but even then, I would always feel like something was \"missing\" when I went home at the end of the night. It was only after I got much older that I realized I must have wanted to become more than just a spectator at such a wonderful event.\n...It's just like how people will always associate the house of \"Naganohara\" with fireworks.

Situated on one of Fontaine's busiest thoroughfares, it is named for its designer.\nThe crisp ringing of a bell chimes from above as if wishing luck to all customers who step through the door. If the rumors swirling about have even a grain of truth to them, then perhaps such blessings will come in handy.\n\"Welcome to the Chioriya Boutique, how may I help you?\" The greeting that reaches your ears, while perhaps lacking somewhat in enthusiasm, is filled with assurance.\nThe owner of the voice shoots you a glance from behind the counter. A striking foreigner with captivating eyes — just like they said.\n\"A personalized, custom job? Or something off the shelf?\" Her second question. The tone fills you with a certain feeling — as though the second someone steps through the door, even the highest-ranking aristocrat becomes merely a guest in her kingdom, while she sits high upon her throne, allowing supplicants to choose from among the blessings she offers.\n\"I'd like tailor-made formal attire.\" You say. Her expression softens a little. It appears that in this kingdom, customizing the cut of the cloth to the customer and designing a personalized outfit in the Kingdom's name is something worth a smile.\nPerhaps this is the best possible outcome, you muse to yourself. After all, those who recommended the shop to you not only all praised the exquisite handiwork of this designer, but some nearly couldn't stop themselves from opening wide their wardrobes to show off the dazzling contents within, as though they wished nothing more than to shove you inside to bask in the clothes' glory for a day. They even say that the owner of the shop is rarely found within, and if she is on the premises, that means she is in a good mood.\nBut you quietly swallow all the same, for you know when fortune does not hold you in her fickle favor, then all manner of unimaginable and outrageous things may occur when the owner is in, such as...\nBefore you can even get a handle on your thoughts and feelings, the bell above the door screams a metallic protest. The boutique's door has been kicked wide open by a man swaying and rocking, foul breath reeking of alcohol and language yet more foul spilling out of his mouth.\n\"I—I won! I won the bet, the Boss is in toda—\" Though you could not clearly see just what happened, before he even finished speaking, he suddenly flew out the window, drawing an elegant arc through the air.\nChiori brushes her hands and closes the window, before saying to you, as if nothing had happened, \"Apologies, the weather has been somewhat inclement of late. All kinds of trash have come blowing into my shop. It's been taken care of, so pay it no heed.\"\nIt appears this kingdom does not welcome all unconditionally."

After all, in her own estimation, there was nothing special at all about her past.\nChiori was born into a family of merchants. Though not well-off by any means, she had lacked for nothing in her childhood. Busy with their business, her parents had not been overly strict with her. This, her parents joked, is what had created her carefree and unbridled nature.\nAt the age when many young girls began to study the art of tea or of flowers, Chiori was climbing trees and catching fish with other children... It wasn't that her parents never tried to get her to learn. But making Chiori sit quietly in front of a tea table for an entire day? Why, that would be the death of her (and of her teacher).\n—Alright, then let's just have her study the art of the sword, said her father.\nBefore long, Chiori was carrying two swords with her to class. \"Two is obviously better,\" she declared, boldly and confidently, dual blades in hand.\nHer teacher had never seen a student with — his words to her father were tactfully chosen — such personality. And thus a seething Chiori was sent back home.\nSimilar scenes played out many times, yet Chiori's parents were never too harsh with her, only believing \"That's just how she is.\"\nUntil one day, Chiori's mother came home to discover her sitting quietly before the table, staring entranced at a bolt of high-quality fabric. The Chiori that was normally bouncing off the walls was nowhere to be found.\n\"Do you like it?\" Asked her mother. \"It feels so smooth,\" came little Chiori's blunt answer, \"And it's so pretty, how was it made?\"\nAnd thus, in the days that followed, Chiori sent tailoring teacher after teacher storming off in frustration, just as before. But at the same time, she also learned many tailoring techniques.\nAlso, in all fairness, it should be mentioned that Chiori was already far more well-behaved with the tailors than she had been with all those other teachers."

And the name of that storm was \"Chiori.\"\nThe storm took shape on the journey out of Inazuma. From the very beginning, it had decided to let loose its thunder upon the streets of Fontaine — the capital of fashion and the City of the Arts.\nAt first, it was only a few rumblings from the diverse firmament of the fashion world that nobody paid much heed to.\n\"It's just a fad, that's all,\" \"It'll be forgotten in a few days\"... That's what they all said at first, as though they were discussing nothing more than a cat of unusual coloration that had appeared on the streets.\nYet after this storm named \"Chiori\" struck that year's Fontaine Fashion Week, nearly all could hear the echoes of its thunderous fury reverberating throughout Fontaine.\nIn a flash, the headlines of Fontaine's papers were completely occupied with a foreign name.\nSome critics have opined that quality clothes are not just for looking at, but can also be \"heard.\" In this aspect, Chiori had succeeded. Every stitch and thread of her clothes told a story: the echoes of waves, the breathing of a forest, a sweet spring gushing forth in the desert...\nNaturally, the \"old guard\" of the fashion world could not tolerate this foreign interloper encroaching upon their territory, and thus raised their banners and declared war upon this \"invader,\" using various methods.\nYet everyone can see how it ended. Not only did they taste the bitterness of defeat, but some of them — for the first time in their lives — tasted the feeling of falling butt-first into the gutter."

        "Context": "It is unclear when the Chioriya Boutique gained the nickname of \"intelligence boutique.\" Even Chiori herself is at a bit of a loss as to how this occurred. It's almost as if all she needs to do is share some of the information she has overheard in her shop with her friends, and it will have a tremendous impact on certain matters.\nLater, she came to understand that rather than the Chioriya Boutique being the source of reams of intelligence, it was better to say that rivers of intelligence flowed of their own accord through her doors.\nThose impeccably dressed merchants and government dignitaries were a kaleidoscopic flock of butterflies, each scattering the pollen known as \"intelligence\" from their fluttering wings onto that gorgeous flower called the Chioriya Boutique. Their actual intention was not to pollinate this flower, but rather to flaunt just how much pollen they had to the other butterflies. They consider the amount of information one had on them to be far more worthy of taking pride in than the quantity of gems sewn into one's garments.\n—Have you heard? So-and-so has yet another new flame!\n—Oh, and that one, they seem to have sealed a huge deal with the one from the Maison Gardiennage!\n—You mean the one in charge of transportation? Now I've heard that what he's really transporting is...\n—Shh! You can't say that out loud!\n...\nIf she really had to choose, Chiori would rather not listen to all this. She feels allergic to this sort of pollen, with the primary symptom being difficulty in quietly and wholeheartedly focusing on clothing. Thus, when designing new styles and products, she generally does not show up in her shop.\nBut after realizing the value of such intelligence, she began to take a certain amount of notice on behalf of others. Should the interests of friends or the safety of Fontaine be involved, she would kindly send a letter to give a friendly reminder, or do so to their face. For her, this is no different from tailoring clothes — sewing each element into its proper place.\nIn accordance with a businessperson's principles, Chiori naturally collects some small tokens of \"repayment.\" After all, as she is wont to say: It's only business if there's an exchange."

        "Context": "If you truly wish to understand Chiori's designs, then you must witness Chiori fashioning clothes with your own eyes.\nThe first time people see said designs, it's as if they cannot comprehend what is before them. Does this designer not know what \"rules\" are? How can women's clothes be tailored like men's? How can men's formalwear use women's fabrics?\nYet there is some quality within that attracts them, and halts them in their tracks. It's as if all of this rejection and resistance to the \"rules\" is so eminently reasonable that it is plainly saying: You are the ones who are wrong.\nIt is the same for Chiori as she tailors the clothes. From the way she treats the fabric, it is as if she has never seen the material before. Her cuts come from unexpected angles, ignoring the direction of the thread, and sometimes suddenly seizing upon adding a completely new structure halfway through, before upending her own work once again...\nSometimes, she will even draw her sword and swiftly cut the first-rate fabric before her with a clean slash, as though she were not making clothes, but rather dueling — as though she were fighting with the fabric in her hands, vying for authority, with her emerging as the ultimate victor.\nNo one makes clothes as she does, much less converses so with the fabric. Her workstation becomes an operating table, and she knows just what the perfect form of the fabric is, with each stroke of her blade excising lesions and sores from her patient...\nAn employee once complained to Chiori that it was too difficult to cut the style she requested.\n—\"Why? Are your scissors not sharp enough?\"\n—\"No, that's not it... It's just...\"\n—\"Then you can cut it.\"\nShe will make you feel that if you cannot cut and trim clothes exactly as you please, then that is because you're simply too foolish to do so. Yet when you see the clothes she tailors, you will feel that if you cannot live exactly as you please, then that is yet more foolish still.\n\"Ms. Chiori, I would like to ask, just how do you design your clothes?\" —Came the reporter's question.\n—\"However I want.\""

        "Context": "Dreams. Such an ephemeral word, far flimsier than even the thinnest silks Chiori has laid hands on. Yet when worn, they can be heavier and more suffocating than the thickest fabric.\nShe chased her dream all the way to Fontaine, and yet when she finally managed to catch up to it, she discovered that it had once more run even farther away of its own accord.\nSo, what next? Take up the burden of her dream and forge ahead, or just be content with what she had?\n—No. Chiori firmly told herself. I choose neither.\nShe enjoyed the sweet aftertaste dreams left, the satisfaction that filled her. Yet she hated using dreams of the future to urge herself onward. That was itself a kind of shackle.\nShe chooses to live in the present.\nShe will work tirelessly day and night on a piece of clothing, just so that it might grace the stage of Fashion Week. She will also disappear for weeks on a whim, enjoying every sight along the way, the starry sky overhead every night, until finally setting off on the road back home once tired. It all depends on her mood.\nNone can dictate any aspect of her life to her, no one can tell her what she \"should\" do; not even her own dreams. It is almost as if she would toss life itself out the window without a moment's hesitation, should it prove an obstacle to her.\n\"Never give up\" is Chiori's true brand. She has said so herself.\nStrangely, it's as though it is in fact her \"dream\" that has begun actively trying to draw close to her out of fright. As opposed to her chasing it, her dream is attempting to curry favor with her, like a once-wild tamed beast attempting to cozy up to its new master's side.\n—Ms. Chiori, you've said that you want your brand to become fashionable across Teyvat. May I ask when you expect to achieve this goal?\n—Hard to say. Perhaps when I feel like it."

        "Context": "When a Snow-Winged Goose chasing the reflection of the moon leapt into the lake, Chiori awoke. She blinked and yawned, gazing at the black evening dress glittering like the star-studded heavens. The shadows of her dream were melting in her mind, leaving inky traces of sadness.\n\"Scissors, please.\" She pushed herself into a sitting position as her loyal assistant appeared by her side, handing Chiori the tool in her hand.\n\"And a pencil.\" She added, and \"Tamoto\" pulled out a pencil that seemed to have seen quite some use from who knows where.\nWhen seeking inspiration, Chiori prefers solitude to company, and often sets off on her own with little more than the clothes on her back, disliking burdening herself with this and that.\nA notebook is something that nags at her, as though begging her to write something down. A map is too confining, as though seeking to draw lines and boundaries through her empire of fashion without her say-so.\nHer drafts are harder to understand than those of any other designer in the business, for they are often drawn on menus, leaves, or even her own clothing...\nYet her finished products are also more breathtaking than those of any other designer, as they are the distillation of the scenery she has seen, the characters she has met, and even those melted remnants of dreams...\n\"Done.\" She looked at the newspaper before her — or more precisely, the tattered remnants thereof — and nodded in satisfaction. She didn't even remember how she had picked it up today, but that was irrelevant.\nHer drafts are born with such spontaneity, and completed with the same free and easy spirit: They are brought back to the Chioriya Boutique, copied out onto the toile, and then turned into tea-stained taiyaki wrapping paper before finally being laid to rest in the garbage.\nAnd as for the essence of the drafts... They are for customers to admire and acclaim, and for being enshrined on the front page of fashion magazines."

        "Context": "No way forward. Nothing left to do.\nChiori lay prone before the table, eyebrows knitting at her first work. \"Tamoto\" said nothing, as though sleeping — or perhaps it was that she had simply never awoken. Chiori's habit was to use a small amount of cloth to try out her designs on Tamoto before making an outfit. Should the result prove satisfactory, she would then copy the design onto a full-size model. Yet none of her designs had been able to gain the approval of her teacher.\nNot long before, yet another teacher had expelled her. She had gradually come to understand that sometimes, it wasn't that her teachers disliked her designs, but that they simply didn't dare to be the first to adopt such designs. The judgmental gaze of others were threads far harder to snip than the stitches of any clothes.\n\"And what do you think?\" She asked the puppet in front of her. \"Tamoto\" had never complained about her designs, and would happily try on any clothes without protest. But if she could open her mouth, would she say those three words, \"I like it\"?\nNot long before, Ogura Textiles & Kimonos had extended an invitation to Chiori, asking her to work in the shop. Chiori appreciated Ogura Mio's intentions, for among the children studying tailoring, she was one who seemed to admire Chiori's designs.\nBut no. Chiori shook her head, rejecting the idea.\nWhen all was said and done, that was someone's else shop, someone else's name. She didn't like the feeling of dwelling within the home of another.\n\"Fontaine...\" She whispered softly. The word had been bubbling to the surface of her mind of late, as a hummed tune overheard may linger forever in the ear, unforgettable.\nThe books said that was the capital of fashion, a city of the arts. The merchants said it was a place that revered entertainment, and that anything interesting would be liked by everyone there.\nThen, Chiori had thought it too far away. It would take months of travel just to get there. Now, she felt that Inazuma was too far away. Her designs would reach few here.\n\"Fontaine... Fontaine...\" She murmured the name several more times, as though doing so could pull that faraway country closer to her.\nAs she thought of \"Ogura Textiles & Kimonos,\" she found herself speaking another name — \"Chioriya Boutique.\"\n—It was as though her heartstrings had suddenly been plucked and were now humming. The sounds of \"Fontaine\" and \"Chioriya Boutique\" were two notes that seemed to form a perfect harmonious chord.\n\"Fontaine's 'Chioriya Boutique'...\" She closed her eyes and imagined a sign emblazoned with her name appearing on Fontaine's vibrant avenues, and how the people there would sound speaking the strange name. It suddenly all seemed so real to her, as though, at that moment, the real her was already in Fontaine, and the \"her\" left here was merely a shadow she had carelessly left behind in Inazuma.\nShe swiftly sat up and left the house without so much as a word to her parents. They were shocked, and looked at each other in dismay, guessing that perhaps she was going out for a walk to unwind. Yet when she next returned, she had already said her goodbyes to some, and left a few others with no doubt as to what she really thought of them. Either way, the name \"Chiori\" would certainly return to Inazuma's shores long before she did. That was the oath she swore.\n\"I'm leaving tomorrow,\" She said to her parents. That melody humming internally was urging her forward, and she had to go chase the her that was in Fontaine.\nHer mother looked at her father reproachfully, as if to say \"Of all the traits she inherited, it had to have been your personality.\"\nNaturally, her parents didn't try to stop her, as they knew very well that once this child said something, it was already set in stone.\nAs Chiori returned to her room to pack her things, the items on her table suddenly shifted, startling her.\n\"Tamoto\" slowly turned in circles, as though showing off the clothes Chiori had made for her, before happily floating over to Chiori— and in the puppet's outstretched hands was a brilliant Vision."
