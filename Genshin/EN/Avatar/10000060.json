She always knows what to say to achieve the best result, yet she takes no pleasure in playing mind games.\nShe travels far and roams the lands, yet the traveling and roaming are bland to her.\nIn Yelan's eyes, these things are not hobbies, but a means to an end.\nShe even prefers to roll the dice to decide how she will pass the time.\nJust as someone who is so used to spicy food might lose the ability to enjoy ordinary dishes, Yelan finds that only spicy cuisine can bring her satisfaction.\n\"Blandness is synonymous with blindness, while thrills afford clarity.\"\nActing upon said philosophy, she chooses an acute style of life, venturing into many places while hiding in the shadows.\nShe dances with danger, secrets, and a strong sense of achievement — these are the vivid proof of her existence."

Only a few survived the grueling bloodshed.\nOne of her ancestors died, while the other went insane, constituting a huge blow to her family.\nYelan has always wanted to find out what happened back then.

This may be the reason for the peculiarities in her character, Yelan presumed.\nShe had never doubted it until she came of age, until the seal on The Chasm was lifted.\nWith the help of her companions, she unveiled the hidden past of her ancestors.\nThat moment marked a new chapter in her life:\nIn the past, she was a wild beast driven by pure instinct. Drawn to danger, she walked into darkness.\nFrom that moment on, she has found the true meaning of her instinct.\nThat which hides inside her, that constant calling, is not only a source of worry but also a light of guidance.\nIt is the blood of heroes which has been howling for 500 years.\nShe has no fear, for the courage within her makes her strong.

Even the smallest challenge is something she can never get enough of.\nAs an intelligence operative, Yelan takes pride in her skills — she is confident that she can read her opponents' eyes and roll the dice such that they fall outside the rules but well within her designs.\nIf there is a draw, that could only mean one thing: Her opponents are cheating too.\nDon't try to reason with her.

However, the spell requires a pair of such vessels to work. Now that only one bracelet is left, it is no more than a mere accessory.\nHowever, the operation also proved a success for Yelan because her enemy did not get the upper hand, either. And this enemy of hers was no ordinary character — it was none other than \"Regrator,\" Ninth of the Fatui Harbingers.\nYelan infiltrated a secret trade route that was run by Regrator behind the scenes, intercepting the goods and picking the most precious one of them as compensation for her bracelet.\nNow, there once existed a strange mystical beast in times of old. A robe made from its fur would be worth a fortune, and due to its rarity, such a robe is exceptionally hard to procure.\nIn fact, the beast is so powerful that although it died centuries ago, its body remains intact today, and its fur still emits a mysterious fragrance.\nRegrator had intended it as an offer to the Tsaritsa, yet Yelan unexpectedly intercepted it.\nNot only that, she also rejected the style that Snezhnayans had chosen for their Tsaritsa — she yanked the fur off, combined it with Liyue's Ramie yarn, and made a rather fashionable sleeved mantle for herself.\nThis series of happenings could be seen as significant or insignificant — depending on one's perspective. Ultimately, it all boils down to three words: gains and losses.\nThe cycle of gaining and losing is a rather accurate summary of Yelan's life.\nNone of that really bothers her though.

Something must've happened. I can understand if you want to quit.\"\nNingguang stood outside the door, with a serious look on her face but her voice still casual and relaxed.\n\"But it's alright. I work with those I trust, and I trust those I work with. I'm willing to believe that you're here trying to find a way out. All postures, aggressive or defensive, are all means to an end, anyway.\"\nThere was no response, but only a suffocating silence. A long time passed before Ningguang finally heard an answer from behind her:\n\"We both made a mistake: We shouldn't have involved ordinary folk in what we do.\"\n\"Ordinary folk?\"\nEven as Ningguang was formulating thoughts, a flash of blue shot towards her, stopping as it passed her by.\nIn a display of great control from the archer, the arrow quickly shattered into pearls of water and broke into glistening shards of light before touching the ground.\nNingguang turned around and saw Yelan walking up, a bow in hand, blood dripping down from her fingertips.\nOne could only imagine the days and nights of grueling training in archery Yelan had gone through for all her fingers to bleed.\nKnowing Yelan well, Ningguang also understood that she must have been through an uncommonly tough situation. Only that could explain Yelan's uncommon determination to lock herself up for this grueling re-training.\nYelan aimed at the mountain in the distance, a gesture that was also an answer to Ningguang.\nShe released the arrow. Like lightning it shot into the skies, piercing through clouds with might that could shatter the dome of heaven itself. As if responding to the call of an unknown power, waters in the mountains growled and howled, then swirled their way upward in the form of countless arrows.\nWhen they met halfway in the sky, they exploded into a curtain of water, bringing down a squalling shower like those that adorned summer nights.\nAs the sky cleared, there was no rainbow, no butterflies to be seen, only a faint pillar of light that fell into Yelan's palm.\nAccording to Ningguang, the Vision carries a message: \"From today onward, leave all matters to the extraordinary Yelan.\""
