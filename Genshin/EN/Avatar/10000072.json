At last, a clang of lance against shield silenced all the quarrels. With lance and shield in her hand, Candace stood up and looked around with a smile, before announcing to the stunned elderly folks around her:\n\"It is good to see you all in such good spirits.\"\n\"But I am the current Guardian of Aaru Village, so please, go and rest, as you should.\"\nThe persuasive power of weapons trumped words at this moment, and it seemed that it would be enough to end the fracas.\nAfter a moment's preparation, Candace accompanied the village head in her station as Guardian to formally receive the caravan and hold trade negotiations with them, before personally escorting them out of the village.\nA few days later, the merchants visited again and completed this seemingly humble transaction regarding cloths.\nThis batch of merchants returned to Sumeru City with news of the success of the deal. Soon after, a new topic cropped up among the business-folk of Sumeru, one which had been rarely heard of in the past:\n\"Hey, you know what? Someone went to Aaru Village to do business — and they made a good sum of Mora, too. Think we should give it a shot next time...?\""

From introductions to accommodations, she arranges everything in good order.\nPerhaps she might even be too gentle for the merchants' comfort.\nAfter all, this village is next to Great Red Sand. Leaving the monsters aside, lawless bandits must have long had this village in their sights.\nIs the Guardian truly capable of protecting everyone... and their business as well?\nOne night, a drunken merchant dared to ask:\n\"Guardian, we can do business in this village, no problem.

Their despicable souls shall find company only with the desert sands.\nA former member of the Eremites once warned his companions that Candace, the terrifying Guardian of the village, is a true descendant of King Deshret.\nThe shield in her hand possesses the blessing of Al-Ahmar, such that as long as its wielder holds it tightly, every grain in the great desert will heed her call. So if Candace so wishes, she could even send forth a huge sandstorm to engulf all her foes.\nNot only that, her amber left eye can also perceive the future and read the fates of others.

Some came to believe that since they were not being watched, they didn't have to obey the rules either, and so acted recklessly, even in violation of the law.\nBut Candace was not depressed.\n\"My lance and shield are not wielded as a prayer for a god's blessing.\"\n\"My duty will not change, regardless of whether any god favors us or not.\"\nShe practices diligently day after day and through this has forged both an extraordinary will and martial skills.\nMany who have visited Aaru Village have extended invitations to Candace, wondering why someone as capable as her would choose to live in such an inconspicuous place.

Seeing that the village was in such a situation, they again held a meeting and prepared to challenge her.\n\"What we Guardians must do is maintain order in the village!\"\n\"Candace!
