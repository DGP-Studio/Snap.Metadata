As an assistant, she needs only misdirect the audience at opportune moments, ensuring the spotlight stays on the protagonist.\nWhether on or offstage, Lynette habitually hides behind Lyney, in shadows that neither lights nor compliments can penetrate.\nFor an assistant, keeping a low profile is a professional matter.\nAnd as for a child of the \"House\"... being cloaked in shadow is how one survives."

One tends toward the light, absorbing the audience's attention. The other faces the darkness, pulling levers and strings in the rear to complete the trick — each side turns the other in endless permutations.\nIf they are to operate in harmony, the assistant's skills cannot be far behind those of the magician themselves.\nBut with such skill, how could one long be content to live in another's shadow? Thus do many assistants, once their skills are fully developed, strike out on their own — they will not forever remain the pupil.\nWhen Lyney became famous, many notables took notice of Lynette's potential, believing that she could achieve greater stardom still should she become an independent act. Some even asked her to take up the role of a leading actress in their films.\nCat ears on young lady, who was also a magician... Even with those gimmicks alone, there was a fortune to be made!\nAlas, these passionate entreaties fell on deaf ears, and not only would Lynette reject them... She could not even be bothered to come up with reasons for doing so, instead leaving the task of coming up with them to Lyney instead.\nThis was quite the conundrum indeed, for many of those making requests were distinguished members of society. \"Father\" had left clear instructions — they were not to be treated with contempt.\nAnd if his authorship were to be discovered, any further meetings with them might turn awkward.\nSo Lyney had no choice but to write letter after letter of refusal in Lynette's manner of speech, filling each to the margins with polite and earnest words.\nEven one as silver-tongued as Lyney found it exceeding difficult to mimic her laconic manner of speech.\nExhausted in hand and spirit, glancing at his sister lounging on the sofa, Lyney could not help but think — why not try it for real? He could play the assistant, no problem.\n\"...Don't even think about it.\" Even that flicker of thought could not escape Lynette. She stretched, before flipping over to face him. \"I like being your assistant.\""

When words are had over tea at home, she is also usually the one who makes it while others do the talking.\nAs others discuss all manner of things or engage in light and idle talk, Lynette can be found sitting at the side, holding her cup in two hands, blowing on it to cool it before drinking in small sips.\nHer tongue is naturally sensitive, and she cannot drink tea that is too hot.\nBut to use merely warm water to make tea would be an abominable waste, and to add ice to tea, or pour the tea between two cups to cool it down... Lynette would consider such actions blasphemy.\nIce dilutes the thickness of the drink, and the pouring will affect its layered flavor... Only by blowing on it, puff by small puff of air at a time, may one achieve the ideal temperature, so as to neither scald nor be shorn of flavor.\nAnd once this ideal temperature has been achieved, one should not also drink it all immediately.\nSome teas have greater flavor as you near the bottom of the cup, and a wait of several minutes should be imposed after one mouthful before one may continue on and savor the next sip. That is why she always takes her time when drinking tea.\nBy the time the teapot is empty, the conversation is usually also just about over.\nAnd as for the teaware on the table... That might be best left to someone else, lest she wreck the dishwasher again."

        "Context": "There was once an official in Fontaine who wanted to investigate the cash flow of the Hotel Bouffes d'ete in the previous few months.\nHowever, no sooner had he finished drawing up a draft than his superior hastily called the whole business to a halt.\nThis poor official could never have imagined how this was due to a letter his superior had received, complete with an attached set of photos featuring a tryst the latter had enjoyed with a famous socialite.\nThis superior, too, could never have imagined that this secret had been exposed thanks to his whipping out a handkerchief that did not belong to his wife during a magic show.\nAt that time, he had been all too absorbed in the exciting goings-on onstage, thus failing to notice the gaze directed his way from the shadows.\nThis momentary distraction allowed Lynette to \"steal\" intel from him, all but picking him clean.\nPeople will unconsciously reveal themselves through their outfits, eyes, movements, and even the slight pauses and shifts in their tone...\nWhile most will be unable to get much out of such signs, buried as they are under many confusing details, Lynette is able to use her uncanny powers of observation to catch all such critical details.\nAnd after she connects all these seemingly trivial details, she can tease out intel useful to the Hotel.\nThese \"eyes\" of the Hotel, one in the light and the other in darkness, have stolen all manner of secrets from the famous in Fontaine. Nor have any of these people noticed the theft — to them, it may as well have been magic.\nAnd because she must maintain this razor focus while working, Lynette speaks little to conserve her energy and not divide her attention.\nEven in her daily life, or when she is at rest, she habitually filters out all kinds of useless information...\nThat said, what information counts as useful and what counts as useless is completely up to her.\nFor example, what about machine operating and housework-related skills? Why, if one never does them, one can safely and confidently tuck them away in the back of one's mind.\nAnd when caught up in teatime gossip, one merely needs to occasionally append the conversation with \"I see,\" \"Is that so,\" and \"And then...\" to ensure a smooth-running chat.\nEconomy of energy — just the way she prefers it."

        "Context": "People often believe that Lynette's cat ears are a part of her performance attire, as the same blood flows in her and Lyney's veins, yet he appears no different from ordinary people.\nHowever, Lynette's ears and tail do, in fact, grow on her body — they are real as real can be.\nIt is said that these cat-like features are inherited, but that even as such a bloodline grows thin across generations, instances of \"atavism\" can still occur from time to time.\nWhen she was young, Lynette did not love this particular gift from her ancestors.\nThere would always be some curious kid who would, whether intentionally or inadvertently, point at them and ask her: Why are you different from everyone else? Are you and Lyney not real siblings?\nThe introverted Lynette did not know how to reply, nor could Lyney always be with her. Whenever such things would happen, she could only push her ears down, curl her tail up, and squat in a corner, by herself and beside herself with misery.\nOnly alley cats would come to comfort her, coiling around and rubbing against her ankles.\nShe could not let her brother see her like this, she knew. He already had a great many things to worry about — he did not need this kind of trivial matter on his mind as well.\nBut she could not simply pretend that nothing was wrong — to deceive the genius magician, she had to fool herself first.\nSo she hugged the cat tightly to herself, softly brushing the fur on its back. As she felt its light breath, calm slowly returned to her heart.\nBy the time the cat leapt from her arms, her face had regained its usual placid appearance.\nAmong Fontaine's nobility, there are also some novelty-seeking degenerates. During one party, a certain \"important person\" found themselves taken with Lynette's unusual appearance.\nOver her protests, despite her struggling, the siblings' foster father stuffed her into that person's carriage without a second thought, almost as if giving away a sofa-scratching cat.\nWhy her? Why was she born with these ears?\nIn her suffocating solitude, Lynette once again covered her ears in pain, unable to hold back the bitterness repressed over long years.\n\"Stop hiding. Cowering will get you nowhere.\" That voice shone through the darkness with the moonlight. \"Come out. The one who wished to harm you is dead.\"\nThat voice was cruel ice, and yet it had a spellbinding, comforting power also. Lynette lifted her eyes, and there she saw the person she would in later days call \"Father.\"\n\"You have good ears. Learn to use them.\"\n\"Father\" kneaded Lynette's ears. That touch was not gentle. Indeed, they were as cold as the moon's light.\nAnd like that light, it illuminated a corner of the darkness.\n...\n\"When a cat's ears are folded backward, that often indicates fear or vigilance, and if they stand up and point forward, that usually indicates a good mood...\"\nWhenever Lyney tells new members of Hotel Bouffes d'ete about the habits of ordinary cats, he will often steal a glance at his younger sister nearby.\nLynette's ears are straight, they face the front, and they occasionally flutter outward.\nIt has been a long time since she last folded them back."

        "Title": "Non-Automated Feeding Machine",
        "Context": "This is a made-to-order automated feeding machine that Freminet helped construct, intended to deal with the ever-increasing number of small animals at home.\nAfter a certain performance ended, Lynette discovered an abandoned box at the theater's back door.\nAs she opened it, a few kittens, barely a month old, raised their heads in alarm. Yet they had not the strength to flee, and thus could only stare into her eyes anxiously.\nLynette said nothing, nor did she reach out to further startle them. Instead, she simply looked back at them in silence.\nSlowly they seemed to come to the understanding that she meant them no harm, and eventually dipped their straining necks.\nOnly then did Lynette pick the box of cats up, and they laid down in silence, allowing this young lady to take them back to their new \"home.\"\nThere was some small debate amongst family members as to whether the animals should be taken in, but the usually reticent Lynette put her foot down, insisting that they stay.\nThe argument somehow managed to reach the ears of none other than \"Father,\" and she had the final word — which was that her children should cease the silly squabbling.\n\"Those who wish to raise them, do so yourselves — but do it well. Don't make trouble for others.\"\nAfter a short silence, she then added, \"And if you have not taught them how to follow the rules by the end of winter, get rid of them yourselves.\"\nThat statement put paid to the rest of the argument. As for the task of teaching the cats, it fell to Lynette.\nConsidering that Lynette was usually averse to busywork, Freminet had the automated feeding machine custom made.\nThe machine came with an internal clock and a weighing machine that could allow it to feed the kittens various foods at precise times and in fixed amounts.\nThis machine, in turn, became one of the few machines to survive Lynette's tender mercies, never breaking down across many years of service. Indeed, its inner components have remained spanking new, with only the plate beneath the food outlet showing much sign of use.\nAnd this... is because Lynette has never used it properly.\nThe sort of food to add into each box, how to input feeding times and amounts... Rather than memorize that, she found it more convenient to personally prepare the cat food in a plate.\nMoreover, if she had to leave even feeding to a machine...\nLynette squatted next to the Non-Automated Feeding Machine, stroking the satisfied cats' fur in silent thought.\n...How would she be able to teach these children?"

        "Title": "Vision",
        "Context": "When Lynette was young, she often heard stories about Visions from Lyney.\nThe protagonists of these tales seemed omnipotent, capable of summoning storms with a flick of the finger or dispelling dark haze with a puff of air.\nThose were not meticulously prepared magic tricks, no — this was the realm of true miracles.\nIf only we had Visions too, Lynette often thought.\nThen they could turn magic tricks into real magic. They could pull food to fill their stomachs or fire to keep themselves warm from a hat. Lyney wouldn't constantly be busy just keeping them both alive.\nBut the gods never answered her prayers. In the days that followed, she and Lyney would wander on, and after several twists and turns on the city streets and in noble mansions, they found a place to plant their feet, under the aegis of their \"Father.\"\nBoth of them knew how hard this chance was to come by, and so they endured the harsh training and supported each other through countless missions.\nReality had eroded their childish innocence all too early, and the dream of possessing a Vision, too, had fallen by the wayside, relegated to a long-gone past.\nDuring one particular mission, they were dispatched to perform at a noble's mountain villa in order to steal incriminating evidence that their target had hidden in a study.\nThe mission itself was ordinary, and it went quite well. During their performance, the two tampered with a window in the villa. Once the show was over, they would be able to re-enter stealthily and make off with the evidence without a trace.\nBut just as they thought they had succeeded, three flares went up in the forest outside the window — a message from their \"family members\" keeping watch.\nThree flares meant the worst-case scenario: that the Maison Gardiennage was also targeting this person, and indeed had already dispatched forces to the scene.\nIf they retreated the way they came, there was a high chance of encountering Maison personnel, and if they were exposed as having used their status as magicians to conduct their mission, not only would they be doomed, but their \"family members\" would be implicated as well.\nThe voices outside the study were growing louder — if they wished to escape as quickly and stealthily as possible, they would have to make a desperate gamble.\nThe villa retreat was built against the mountain, and outside the window was a cliff, beneath which flowed a swift river.\nLynette exchanged a glance with her brother, and without a word, they grasped each others' hands tightly, and leapt out the window together.\nThe rippling waves below slammed into Lyney with a terrible crash.\nHe had attempted to absorb the impact with his shoulder just as they hit, protecting his sister once again, but the shock of the collision with the water swallowed his consciousness.\nDesperate, Lynette grabbed onto a floating piece of wood, and by sheer dint of will managed to drag her unconscious brother to shore, coughing up water as she struggled on.\nFighting the searing pain in her lungs, she checked his condition in a panic. He was deathly pale, his eyes squeezed shut — there was no trace of his usual vitality to be seen.\nShe hugged him tightly to prevent his temperature from dropping further, even as she surveyed her surroundings. The forest was dark and gloomy, and under cover of night the twisted trees seemed even more malevolent.\nShe called his name softly, hoping that he might stand up again with a grin, just as he would do in their prior performances. But this time, the only reply she received was his weak and fragile breathing.\nThe same loneliness and fear of that fateful night so many years ago seized her heart once again.\n\"It's been so long, and we've been through so much — I thought I had grown beyond this!\nWhy, then, is it just like that night? Can I do nothing but wait under the protection of another? As I do nothing but tremble in the darkness?\nNo. No. It should be different. We made so many miracles by our own hands, conquered so many obstacles.\n...I wished so dearly, so ardently, to stand behind you, supporting you, back to back, shoulder to shoulder.\"\nThe Maison personnel could be patrolling nearby. She dared not call out to their \"family members,\" nor could they stay here.\nThe only thing she could do now was grasp Lyney's hand tightly, and haul him onto her shoulders.\nIf she could not see the way forward, then she would hear it.\nExtending her ears as much as she could, she listened intently for even the slightest wisp of wind.\nAnd then, as the breeze sang through the branches and through the bushes, and brushed against her face... and it gradually painted her a blurry picture.\nLynette groped forward in the dark, the thorns along the path piercing her skin, staining her clothes red.\nSlowly, the scene before her eyes became clearer. Perhaps her ears had grown used to listening to the wind, or her eyes accustomed to the darkness, but her steps grew more agile, more resolute.\nOn this stage without spotlights, in this performance without plaudits, Lynette had at last become the star.\nAs the rays of dawn lanced into the woods, Lynette carried her brother back to the rendezvous point of their \"family,\" only to encounter someone wholly unexpected — their \"Father\" had arrived, having especially made the trip in person the previous night.\nUsing the last of her strength, Lynette retrieved the sodden evidence from her bosom, but before she could hand it over, her legs gave out, taking Lyney down with her as she collapsed.\n\"Father\" grabbed them both, allowing the incriminating information to fall to the earth and be soiled.\n\"Sleep now. You've retrieved... a far more valuable prize.\"\nA Vision, reflecting both the dawn sun and the twins' sleeping faces, hung at Lynette's waist, glowing silently."
