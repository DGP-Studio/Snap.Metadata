It could surpass the limits of her lifespan and defend Inazuma forever. Yet, how could creating a copy of an Archon be a simple affair?\nEi conducted countless experiments to this effect, discarded a great many failed products, and spent an unimaginable amount of time and resources—\nBut at last, by her dogged pursuit and warrior's spirit, she was able to create a flawless puppet.\nThe newborn Raiden Shogun sat there silently, listening to Ei speak all about her, \"her,\" and even about them. The future of Inazuma was here, inscribed upon a gorgeous blueprint.\nThe automaton had but one question to ask Ei: \"There is no turning back from forsaking your form.

However, Ei also had moments of repose away from battle, sitting with her friends under the sakura trees and playing karuta.\nDue to her character, Ei was always the most wooden player. She was never the final victor, nor did she ever have a taste of the prizes that the Kitsune Saiguu reserved for the winners.\nThus, she poured the effort that she put into swordsmanship into karuta practice, often pestering Makoto or Mikoshi Chiyo for karuta matches, or spending much time by moonlight reading the poetry inscribed on the cards out loud.\nAt last, the day came that under a sakura tree's shade, Ei would defeat opponent after opponent. Even the mighty tengu would be felled after a hard-fought battle, and thus was she crowned the champion.\nEi let out a victorious whoop at her victory, only to be greeted by the sounds of her friends' laughter. Only then did she realize that she had lost her usual composure entirely, before snapping both arms back down and reverting to her usual cool facade.\n Of course, her friends did not intend to make sport of her. Indeed, they understood her character and the manner in which she had worked ever so hard to come out on top.\nAs for the Kitsune Saiguu, oh, how amused she looked as she presented Ei with some pastries.\n\"I said it was a reward, yes, but it was simply some hand-made cakes of mine. I didn't think that you would be so concerned about it, Ei. Well then, enjoy the spoils of your victory to your heart's content.\"\nEi was hardly one to be greedy for snacks. But as a samurai, she firmly believed that what she lost must be reclaimed. These pastries were more akin to a vindication of her desire to win.\n—But it was not long before that cool demeanor of hers broke into a smile again. The cakes were lovely — just like the taste of victory. As for her clumsy attempts to hide that smile, one could only say that it was an entertaining sight all around for her friends.\nTo this day, Ei still often remembers that sakura tree.\n...Even though she has not gone to see it in a long time, and even though no one sits under it anymore, she wishes that time might stop forever."

Instead, Makoto's energies were focused on the present.\n\"It is precisely because we know that this scene is but a fleeting shadow that we should enjoy it all the more.\"\nThen, Ei could only smile wryly, realizing that she, the kagemusha, was even more old-fashioned than the real Raiden Shogun. She thought to herself that she must learn to be more leisurely, just like Makoto.\nYet the times changed all too quickly, all but catching Ei off guard. Before she knew it, her hands already held the blade that the dying Raiden Makoto had passed on to her.\nThis day, the kagemusha was now the true Raiden Shogun.\nAnd it was on this day that Ei truly felt the agony of erosion.\nAs time marched forward inexorably, even this blade, this sakura... All life on Inazuma would fade before her eyes.\nThis was the foundation of Inazuma, and it was the thing that the Raiden Shogun must defend.\n\"If you look at it this way, thinking ahead is not meaningless, nor is it vain arrogance.\"\nHaving resolved herself, her life exceeded its mortal shell, and eternity descended upon the mortal plane."

Thus, you have become my enemy.\"\nBack when she was creating the puppet, Ei had considered all the hidden risks involved.\nShe believed that anything was possible — including the worst-case scenario... in which she too would someday become a threat to Eternity.\nBut she had to press on. She had to reach Eternity. This, she would not permit to be stayed by any outside force.\nThe puppet's words were something that she had asked herself long ago:\n\"You believe your present self has greater certainty than your former self. Thus, you believe your present self is correct. Don't you?\"\n\"But have you really been enlightened with new ideas? Or have you been degraded by irreversible erosion?\"\nTheir faces were the same, but they spoke of different ideals. The battle with herself, with her past, would come someday.\nBut it was not this day. Ei knew well that she was not yet ready.\nHer heart had been clear, and she would have remained in that state, but hearing the cries of her people, she had to command her feet to stop.\nThe sky above the mirror was no longer empty, and all about the silent halls, she heard the cry of crows.

Even if you sold it, I trust that you would have exchanged it for something of equal value, and that is no easy price to pay.\"\nWith someone of Yae Miko's character, it would be no surprise if she ever sold the Gnosis, yes, but she would not allow herself to lose out in any such exchange.\nSuch, then, was the tacit agreement between the two old friends.
